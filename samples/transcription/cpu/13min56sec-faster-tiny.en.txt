 Senator from Illinois is recognized for 10 minutes.  Thank you very much, Madam President.  And thank you to the distinguished senator from Connecticut,  not only for yielding time, but also for the extraordinarily hard work  that he's put in over the last several days.  And in fact, over a week, and I want to thank his counterparts  on the other side, including Senator Greg for their hard work.  Now, the fact that we're even here voting on a plan  to rescue our economy from the greed and irresponsibility  of Wall Street and some in Washington is an outrage.  It's an outrage to every American who works hard, pays their taxes,  and is doing their best every day to make a better life for themselves  and their families.  And understandably, people are frustrated and they're angry.  The Wall Street's mistakes have put their tax dollars at risk,  and they should be.  I'm frustrated and angry, too.  But while there's plenty of blame to go around,  and many in Washington and Wall Street who deserve it,  all of us, all of us, have a responsibility to solve this crisis  because it affects the financial well-being of every single American.  There will be time to punish those who set this fire.  But now's not the time to argue about how it got set  or did the neighbor sleep in his bed or leave the stove on.  Right now, we want to put out that fire.  And now's the time for us to come together and do that.  When the House of Representatives failed act on Monday,  we saw the single largest decline in the stock market  in two decades.  Over $1 trillion of wealth was lost by the time the market's closed.  And wasn't just the wealth of a few CEOs or Wall Street executives.  The 401Ks and retirement accounts of millions became smaller.  The state pension funds of teachers and government employees lost billions  upon billions of dollars, hardworking Americans who invested their nest egg  to watch a gross odd diminish and in some cases disappear.  And while that decline was devastating,  the consequences of the credit crisis that caused it  will be even worse if we do not act now.  We're in a very dangerous situation where financial institutions  across this country are afraid to lend money.  And if all that meant was the failure of a few banks in New York,  that would be one thing.  But that's not what it means.  What it means is if we don't act, it will be harder for Americans  to get a mortgage for their home or loans they need to buy a car  or send their children to college.  What it means is that businesses won't be able to get the loans they need  to open a new factory or make payroll for their workers.  And if they can't make payroll on Friday,  then workers are laid off on Monday.  And if workers are laid off on Monday, then they can't pay their bills  or pay back their loans to somebody else.  And it will go on and on and on,  rippling through the entire economy.  Potentially, we could see thousands of businesses close.  Millions of jobs could be lost.  And a long and painful recession could follow.  In other words, this is not just a Wall Street crisis.  It's an American crisis.  And it's the American economy that needs this rescue plan.  I understand completely why people would be skeptical  when this president asked for a blank check to solve this problem.  I was, too, as was Senator Dodd, and a whole bunch of us here.  And that's why over a week ago, I demanded  that this plan include some specific proposals  to protect taxpayers, protections that the administration eventually agreed  to and thanks to the hard work of Senator Dodd  Republican counterparts like Senator Greg.  We here in the Senate have agreed to it.  And now, hopefully, the House will agree to as well.  Let me just go over those principles.  Number one, I said we needed an independent board  to provide oversight and accountability for how  and where this money is spent at every step of the way.  Number two, I said that we cannot help banks on Wall Street  without helping the millions of innocent homeowners  who are struggling to stay in their homes.  They deserve a plan, too.  Number three, I said that I would not allow this plan  to become a welfare program for Wall Street executives  whose greed and irresponsibility got us into this mess.  And finally, I said that if Americans taxpayers  are financing this solution, then they  have to be treated like investors.  They should get every penny of their tax dollars back  once the economy recovers.  Now, this last part is important because it's been the most  misunderstood and poorly communicated part of this plan.  This is not a plan to just hand over $700 billion  of taxpayer money to a few banks.  If this is managed correctly, and that's an important if,  we will hopefully get most or all of our money back  and possibly even turn a profit on the government's  intervention, every penny of which  will go directly back to the American people.  And if we fall short, we will levy a fee on financial  institutions so that they can repay for the losses  that they cost.  Now, let's acknowledge, even with all these taxpayer  protections, this plan is not perfect.  Democrats and Republicans in Congress  have legitimate concerns about it.  Some of my closest colleagues, people I  have the greatest respect for still have problems with it  and may choose to vote against this bill.  And I think that we can respectfully disagree.  I understand their frustrations.  I also know that many Americans share their concerns.  But it's clear that, for my perspective,  this is what we need to do right now to prevent the possibility  of a crisis turning into a catastrophe.  It is conceivable.  It's possible that if we did nothing,  everything would turn out OK.  It's there's a possibility that that's true.  And there's no doubt that there may be other plans  out there that had we had two or three or six months  to develop might be even more refined  and might serve our purposes better.  But we don't have that kind of time.  And we can't afford to take a risk  that the economy of the United States of America  and as a consequence, the worldwide economy  could be plunged into a very, very deep hole.  So to Democrats and Republicans who have opposed this plan,  I say, step up to the plate.  Let's do what's right for the country at this time,  because the time to act is now.  I know many Americans are wondering what happens next.  And passing this bill can't be the end of our work  to strengthen our economy.  It must be the beginning.  Because one thing I think all of us who  may end up supporting this bill understand  is that even if we get this in place,  we could still have enormous problems  and probably will have big problems in the economy  over the next several months and potentially longer.  Because the fact is is that we have seen some mismanagement  of the fundamentals of the economy for a very long time.  And we are not going to dig ourselves out of that hole  immediately.  So this is not the end, this is the beginning.  As soon as we pass this rescue plan,  we need to move aggressively with the same sense of urgency  to rescue families on Main Street who are struggling  to pay their bills and keep their jobs.  They've been in crisis a lot longer than Wall Street has.  I said it before and I say it again.  We need to pass an economic stimulus package  that will help ordinary Americans cope  with rising food and gas prices that can save 1 million jobs,  rebuilding our schools and roads and our infrastructure  and help states and cities avoid budget cuts and tax  increase, a plan that would extend  expiring unemployment benefits for those Americans  who've lost their jobs and cannot find new ones.  That's the right thing to do at a time  when consumer confidence is down.  And we are in great danger of slipping into a big recession.  We also must do more in this rescue package  in order to help homeowners stay in their homes.  I will continue to advocate.  Bankrupti reforms, I know my colleague from Illinois,  Dick Durbin has been a strong champion of this  as have many.  It is the right thing to do to change our bankruptcy laws  so that people have a better chance of staying  in their homes and we're not seeing communities  devastated all across the country.  And we should encourage Treasury to study the option  of buying individual mortgages like we did successfully  in the 1930s.  And finally, while we all hope that this rescue package succeeds,  we should be prepared to take more vigorous actions  in the months ahead to rebuild capital if it's necessary.  And just as families are planning for their future  and tough times, Washington's going to have to do the same.  We're on a way spending.  And record deficits are not how families run their budgets.  It can't be how Washington handles people's tax dollars.  So we're going to have to return to the fiscal responsibility  we had in the 1990s.  And the next White House and the next Congress  is going to have to work together to make sure  that we go through our budget.  We get rid of programs that don't work,  that we make the ones that do work better and cost less.  With less money flowing into the Treasury,  some useful programs or policies might need to be delayed.  Some might need to be stretched out over a longer period of time.  But there are certain investments in our future  that we cannot delay precisely because our economy  is in turmoil.  Mr. President, I've exceeded the time a little bit.  I would like unanimous consent for a couple more minutes.  I just think like that.  Is there objection?  Seeing no objection.  Thank you.  There are certain investments in our future  that we can't delay precisely because the economy is  in turmoil.  We can't wait to help Americans keep up with rising costs  and shrinking paychecks.  And we're going to do that by making sure  that we are giving our workers a middle-class tax cut.  We can't wait to relieve the burden  of crushing health care costs.  We can't wait to create millions of new jobs  by rebuilding our roads and our bridges  and investing in broadband lines and rural communities  and fixing our electricity grid so we can get renewable energy  to population centers that need them.  We need to develop an energy policy  that prevents us from sending $700 billion a year  to tyrants and dictators for their oil.  And we can't wait to educate the next generation  of Americans with the skills and knowledge  they need to compete with any workers anywhere in the world.  These are the priorities we cannot delay.  Let me just close by saying this.  I do not think this is going to be easy.  It's not going to come without costs.  We are all going to need to sacrifice.  We're all going to need to pull our weight  because now more than ever we are all in this together.  That's part of what this crisis has taught us.  That in the end of the day, there's no real separation  between Wall Street and Main Street.  There's only the road we're traveling on as Americans.  And we will rise or fall on that journey as one nation  and as one people.  I know that many Americans are feeling anxiety right now  about their jobs, about their homes, about their life savings.  But I also know this, that we can steer ourselves  out of this crisis.  We are always half during the great financial crisis  of the last century in its first fireside jet.  FDR told us fellow Americans that there  is an element in the readjustment of our financial system,  more important than currency, more important than gold.  And that is the confidence of the people themselves.  Confidence and courage are the essentials of success  in carrying out our plan.  Let us unite in banishing fear.  Together, we cannot fail.  We cannot fail.  Not now, not tomorrow, not next year.  This is a nation that's faced down war and depression,  great challenges, and great threats.  And in each and every moment, we have risen to meet up  these challenges.  Not as Democrats, not as Republicans, but as Americans,  with resolve and with confidence.  With that fundamental belief that here in America,  our destiny is not written for us.  It's written by us.  And that's who we are.  And that's the country I know we can be right now.  So I want to thank, again, the extraordinary leadership  of Chairman Dodd in banking committee,  as well as Chairman Bockus and Majority Leader Reid.  They have worked tirelessly.  I want to thank the leadership in the House of Representatives.  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting  this important legislation, understanding  that this will not solve all our problems.  It is a necessary but not sufficient step  to make sure that this economy, once again,  works on behalf of all Americans  in their pursuit of the American dream.  Thank you, Ms. President.  I yield the floor.
