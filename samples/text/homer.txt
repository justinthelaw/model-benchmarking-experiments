It is proposed to give, in these little volumes, some such introductionto the great writers of Greece and Rome as may open to those who havenot received a classical education--or in whose case it has beenincomplete and fragmentary--a fair acquaintance with the contents oftheir writings, and the leading features of their style.The constant allusions in our own literature, and even in our dailypress, to the works of the ancient classical authors, and thefamiliarity with the whole _dramatis personæ_ of ancient history andfable which modern writers on all subjects assume on the part of theirreaders, make such an acquaintance almost necessary for those who carenot only to read but to understand.Even in the case of readers who have gone through the regular classicalcourse in their day, this acquaintance, if honest confession were made,would be found very imperfect. It is said, of course, that “everyEnglish gentleman reads Horace;” but this is one of those generalassertions which rest upon very loose ground. An ordinary observer ofthe habits of the class might find himself somewhat at a loss forinstances.In the case of ladies, and of the large body of general readers who havereceived either no classical education, or a very imperfect one,probably less is now known of Homer, Virgil, or Horace, than in the dayswhen Pope’s, Dryden’s, and Francis’s translations were first published,and took their place for the time on every literary table.There appears a strong probability that the study of Greek and Latin,which has so long been our exclusive idea of a “liberal” education, willhereafter be confined within a narrower circle. Yet some knowledge ofthe ancient classics must continue to be the key to much of our bestEnglish literature. If, as some educational reformers suggest, asystematic course of English reading be substituted for Latin and Greekin our “middle-class” schools, such a training will necessarily involvethe careful study of the masters of English thought and style, and moreespecially of those earlier authors whose taste was formed very muchupon the old classical models, and whose writings are full of allusionsto their characters and imagery.It may be said that we have translations of all the best and mostpopular of the classical authors, and that many of these are admirablein their execution. This is quite true. The Iliad, the Odyssey, theÆneid, Horace, and some of the Greek Dramatists, have lately foundtranslators who, in point of taste and general accuracy, leave little tobe desired. But the results of their work will be best enjoyed andvalued by those whose acquaintance with the originals enables them toappreciate not only the positive beauty of the English version, but itsrelative merit as conveying the spirit and sense of the Greek or Latinauthor. Even the best translation (especially of the classical poets)may fail to have a continuous interest for the merely modern reader,unless he has some previous familiarity with the argument of the work,the personages introduced, and the characteristics of the age in whichthe scene and action lie.The aim of the present series will be to explain, sufficiently forgeneral readers, who these great writers were, and what they wrote; togive, wherever possible, some connected outline of the story which theytell, or the facts which they record, checked by the results of moderninvestigations; to present some of their most striking passages inapproved English translations, and to illustrate them generally frommodern writers; to serve, in short, as a popular retrospect of the chiefliterature of Greece and Rome. The attempt appeals, as will be seen, toa circle outside that of classical scholarship; though possibly some whohave all legal claim to rank as scholars, but who now stand rather onthe “retired list” of that service, may in these pages meet some oldacquaintances whom they have almost forgotten. If, in any case, theyfind our re-introduction unsatisfactory, none would advise them moreheartily than we do to renew the old personal intercourse forthemselves.CONTENTS.

CONCLUDING REMARKS,                                        139It has been thought desirable in these pages to use the Latin names ofthe Homeric deities, as more familiar to English ears. As, however, mostmodern translators have followed Homer’s Greek nomenclature, it may beconvenient here to give both.        Zeus          = Jupiter.        Herè          = Juno.        Arēs          = Mars.        Poseidōn      = Neptune.        Pallas Athenè = Minerva.        Aphroditè     = Venus.        Hephaistos    = Vulcan.        Hermes        = Mercury.        Artemis       = Diana.The passages marked (D.) are from Lord Derby’s translation; (W.) from MrWorsley’s; and (P.) Pope’s.INTRODUCTION.It is quite unnecessary here to discuss the question, on which thelearned are very far from being agreed, whether Homer--the “Prince ofPoets”--had any real existence; whether he was really the author of thetwo great poems which bear his name, or whether they are the collectedworks of various hands, dovetailed into each other by some clever editorof ancient times. Homer will still retain his personality for theuncritical reader, however a sceptical criticism may question it. Theblind old bard, wandering from land to land, singing his lays of the oldheroic times to a throng of admiring listeners, must always continue tobe the familiar notion of the author of the Iliad and the Odyssey. Suchwas the universal creed of the world of readers until a comparativelyrecent date; and the speculations of modern scholars, in this as inother cases, have been much more successful in shaking the popularbelief than in replacing it by any constructive theory of their ownwhich is nearly so credible. “Homer” is quite as likely to have beenreally Homer, as a mere name under whose shadow the poems of variousunknown writers have been grouped.There is extant a Life of the poet, said to have been composed by theGreek historian Herodotus, quoted as such by early writers, andpossibly, after all, quite as trustworthy as the destructive conjecturesof those critics who would allow him no life at all. There we are toldthat his birth, like that of so many heroes of antiquity, wasillegitimate; that he was the son of Critheis, who had been betrayed byher guardian; that he was born near Smyrna, on the banks of the riverMeles, and was thence called “Melesigenes.” His mother is saidafterwards to have married a schoolmaster named Phemius, by whom the boywas adopted, and in due course succeeded to his new father’s occupation.But the future bard soon grew weary of such confinement. He set out tosee the world; visiting in turn Egypt, Italy, Spain, the islands of theMediterranean, and gathering material for at least one of his greatworks, the adventures of the hero Odysseus (Ulysses), known to us as theOdyssey. In the course of his travels he became blind, and thence wascalled “Homeros”--“the blind man”--such at least is one of theinterpretations of his name.[1] In that state returning to his nativetown of Smyrna, he, like his great English successor, Milton, composedhis two great poems. One of the few passages in which any personalallusion to himself has been traced, or fancied, in Homer’s verse, is ascene in the Odyssey, where the blind harper Demodocus is introduced assinging his lays in the halls of King Alcinous:--    “Whom the Muse loved, and gave him good and ill--     Ill, that of light she did his eyes deprive;     Good, that sweet minstrelsies divine at will     She lent him, and a voice men’s ears to thrill.” (W.)So, in the same poem, the only other bard who appears is alsoblind--Phemius, who is compelled to exercise his art for the diversionof the dissolute suitors of Penelope. The fact of blindness is in itselfby no means incompatible with the notion of Homer’s having constructedand recited even two such long poems as the Iliad and the Odyssey. Theblind have very frequently remarkable memories, together with a readyear and passionate love for music.For the rest of his life, Homer is said to have roamed from city to cityas a wandering minstrel, singing his lays through the towns of AsiaMinor, in the islands of the Archipelago, and even in the streets ofAthens itself, and drawing crowds of eager listeners wherever he went bythe wondrous charm of his song. This wandering life has been assumed toimply that he was an outcast and poor. The uncertainty of hisbirthplace, and the disputes to which it gave rise in after times, werethe subject of an epigram whose pungency passed for truth--    “Seven rival towns contend for Homer dead,     Through which the living Homer begged his bread.”But the begging is not in the original lines at all, and a wanderingminstrel was no dishonoured guest, wherever he appeared, in days muchlater than Homer’s. Somewhere on the coast of the Levant he died andwas buried, leaving behind him that name which retains its spell hardlyweakened by the lapse of some twenty-seven centuries, and the two greatpoems which have been confessedly the main source of the epic poetry,the heroic drama, and the early romance of Europe.Other works are ascribed to Homer’s name besides the Iliad and theOdyssey, but the authorship appears more doubtful. If we trust theopinion of Aristotle, Homer was the father of comic narrative poetry aswell as of epic. The poem called ‘Margites,’ attributed to him,contained the travels and adventures of a wealthy and pedantic coxcomb:but slight fragments only of this have been preserved--enough to showthat the humour was somewhat more gross than one would expect from thepoet of the Odyssey, though redeemed, no doubt, by satire of a higherkind, as in the surviving line which, in describing the hero’saccomplishments, seems to anticipate the multifarious and somewhatsuperficial knowledge of the present day--    “Full many things he knew--and ill he knew them all.”Admitting the personality of the poet himself, and his claim to theauthorship of both Iliad and Odyssey, it is not necessary to supposethat either poem was framed originally as a whole, or recited as a wholeupon every occasion. No doubt the song grew as he sung. He wouldprobably add from time to time to the original lay. The reciter, whoseaudience must depend entirely upon him for their text, has an almostunlimited licence of interpolation and expansion. It may be fairlygranted also that future minstrels, who sung the great poet’s laysafter his death, would interweave with them here and there something oftheir own, more or less successful in its imitation of the original.Such explanation of the repetitions and incongruities which are to befound in the Iliad seems at least as reasonable as the supposition thatits twenty-four books are the work of various hands, “stitchedtogether”--such is one explanation of the term “rhapsody”--in aftertimes, and having a common origin only in this, that all sung of the“wondrous Tale of Troy.”That tale was for generations the mainspring of Greek legend and song,and the inspiration of Greek painters and sculptors. At this day, theattempt to separate the fabulous from the real, to reduce the richcolouring of romance into the severe outlines of history, is a taskwhich even in the ablest hands seems hopeless. The legends themselvesare various, and contradictory in their details. The leading charactersin the story--Priam, Helen, Agamemnon, Achilles, Ulysses, Paris, Hectorand Andromache--appear in as many different aspects and relations as thefancy of each poet chose. In this respect they are like the heroes ofour own “Round Table” romances; like Arthur and Guinevere, Lancelot,Tristram, and Percival--common impersonations on whom all kinds ofadventures are fastened, though the main characteristics of the portraitare preserved throughout. What amount of bare historical truth may ormay not underlie the poetical colouring--whether there was or was not areal Greek expedition and a real siege of Troy, less “heroic” and moreprobable in its extent and details than the Iliad represents it--is noquestion to be here discussed. So far as literary interest isconcerned, “the real Trojan war,” as Mr Grote well says, “is that whichis recounted by Homer.” It will be sufficient here to take the poet asour main authority, and to fill up his picture from other legendarysources; for though Homer’s version of the Great Trojan War is theearliest account which has come down to us, he drew his material fromstill earlier lays and legends, with which he assumes all his readers(or hearers) to be tolerably familiar; and which, again, the later poetsand tragedians reproduced with many additions and variations of theirown.The preservation of poems of such great length (the Iliad alone containsbetween fifteen and sixteen thousand lines) in days when writing, evenif invented, was in its infancy, has been the subject of muchspeculation. That they were publicly recited at great national festivalsin all parts of Greece, is undoubted. Professional minstrels, or“rhapsodists,” as they were called, chanted certain selected portionswhich suited their own taste or that of their audience--often such ascontained the exploits of some national hero. They followed possibly inthis the example of the great bard himself; just as certain of our ownpopular writers have lately taken to read, to an admiring public, somefavourite scenes and chapters from their own works. Lycurgus is said tohave brought the collected poems from Asia to Sparta; Solon, at Athens,to have first obliged the minstrels to recite the several portions indue order, so as to preserve the continuity of the narrative.Pisistratus, the great Athenian ruler, has the reputation of havingfirst reduced the whole into a collected shape, and of having thus farsettled the “text” of Homer, employing in this work the most eminentmen of letters of his day. There is a legend of a Homeric ‘Septuagint:’of seventy learned scribes employed in the great work, as in the Greekversion of the Hebrew Scriptures. From the time when the Iliad andOdyssey were reduced to writing, their popularity rather increased thanwaned. They were the storehouse of Greek history, genealogy, andantiquity--the models and standards of literary taste. To beunacquainted with these masterpieces, was to be wholly without cultureand education: and, thanks to their continual and public recital, thiswant was perhaps less prevalent amongst the Greeks than amongstourselves. The young Alcibiades, when receiving the usual education of aGreek gentleman, is said to have struck his tutor one day in a burst ofrighteous indignation, for having made the confession--certainlyinexcusable in his vocation--that he did not possess a copy of the greatpoet. Alexander the Great carried always with him the copy which hadbeen corrected by his master Aristotle, preserved in a jewelled caskettaken amongst the spoils of Darius. No pains were spared in thecaligraphy, or costliness in the mountings, of favourite manuscripts ofthe Homeric poems. They continued to be regarded with almost asuperstitious reverence even during the middle ages of Christendom.Men’s future destinies were discovered, by a sort of rude divination, inverses selected at hap-hazard. Fantastic writers saw in the two poemsnothing more or less than allegorical versions of Hebrew history; andgrave physicians recommended as an infallible recipe for a _quartan_ague, the placing every night a copy of the _fourth_ book of the Iliadunder the patient’s head. Modern critical speculations have gone quiteas far in another direction. In the eyes of some ingenious theorists,this siege of Troy is but “a repetition of the daily siege of the Eastby the solar powers that every evening are robbed of their brightesttreasures in the West;”[2] and the Homeric heroes and their exploits allrepresent allegorically, in one form or another, the great conflictbetween Light and Darkness. But such questions are beyond the scope ofthese pages; we are content here to take the tale of Troy as the poettells it.The supposed date of the story may be taken as some fifteen centuriesbefore the Christian era. The great City of Troy, or Ilium, lay on thecoast of Asia Minor--its reputed site still bearing the name of theTroad, a broad well-watered champaign, with a height still recognised asthe citadel towering above it. “No royal seat of the ancient world,”says a modern visitor to the spot, “could boast a grander situation thanthe Trojan citadel.”[3] As to its actual locality and existence, thereis little ground for scepticism. The tradition of the name and place wasunbroken in the early historical ages of Greece. Xerxes, king of Persia,in his expedition, is said to have visited the citadel, and to haveoffered there a thousand oxen to the tutelary goddess; possibly, it hasbeen suggested, claiming to be the avenger of the Asiatic kings on theirEuropean enemies.[4] Mindarus, the Lacedæmonian admiral, seventy yearslater, sacrificed there also: and Alexander, when he crossed theHellespont, not only did the same, but took from the temple some of thesacred arms which were hung there (said to be those of the heroes ofthe great siege), offering up his own in exchange. The founder of thecity was Ilus, son of Tros, and from these mythical heroes it took itstwo names. But its walls were built by the grandson, Laomedon. Heemployed some remarkable workmen. In one of the most striking andsuggestive fables of the Greek mythology, certain of the gods arerepresented as being condemned by Zeus (or Jupiter) to a period ofservitude upon earth. Poseidon (Neptune) and Apollo were under thiscondemnation, and undertook, for certain rewards, to help Laomedon inhis fortifications. But when the work was finished, the ungrateful kingrepudiated his bargain. As a punishment, a sea-monster is sent to ravagehis dominions, who can only be appeased by the sacrifice of a maiden ofnoble blood. The lot falls upon the king’s own daughter, Hesione. It isthe original version of St George and the Dragon. Laomedon offers hisdaughter, and certain horses of immortal breed (which he seems to counteven a more valuable prize), to the champion who will deliver her andslay the monster. Hercules comes to the rescue; but a second timeLaomedon breaks his word. He substitutes mortal horses, and refuses hisdaughter. Hercules attacks the city, kills Laomedon, and carries off theprincess Hesione, whom he gives to his comrade Telamon. From this unionare born two heroes, Ajax and his brother Teucer, whom we shall meet inthe second and great Siege of Troy, which forms the subject of Homer’sIliad.This double perjury of Laomedon’s is one supposed cause of the wrath ofHeaven resting on the town and its people. Yet Apollo, forgetful, itwould seem, of his former unworthy treatment, and only remembering withaffection the walls which he had helped to build, is represented astaking part with the Trojans in the great struggle, in which the deitiesof Olympus are bitterly divided amongst themselves.But Homer’s Tale of Troy says nothing of Laomedon and his broken faith.His poem is built upon a later legend. This legend embraces in the wholea period of thirty years, divided exactly, in a manner very convenientfor both poet and reader, into complete decades; ten years ofpreparation for the siege, ten occupied in the siege itself (with whichalone the Iliad has to do), and ten consumed in the weary wanderings andfinal return home of the surviving Greek heroes who had taken part inthe expedition.The first decade begins with the carrying off from the court ofMenelaus, king of Sparta, of his wife Helen, by a young Asiatic princewhom he has entertained in his travels. Helen is the reputed daughter ofJupiter by Leda, and upon her Venus has bestowed the fatal endowment ofmatchless and irresistible beauty. The young prince whom she unhappilycaptivates is Paris or Alexander, son of Priam, king of Troy. Terribleoracles had accompanied the birth of him who was to prove the curse ofhis father’s people. His mother Hecuba dreamed that she gave birth to aflaming brand. The child when born was exposed on Mount Ida, so as toinsure his death in infancy without incurring the guilt of blood. But,as in similar legends, the precaution did but help to fulfil theprophecy. In the solitudes of the mountain he grew up, a boy of wondrousbeauty, the nursling and the favourite of Venus. There he was calledupon to decide to whom the “Prize of Beauty”--the golden apple thrownby Discord into the feast of the Immortals, with that insidious legendinscribed on it--should be awarded. Three competing goddesses--Juno,Venus, and Minerva, who at least, as the goddess of wisdom, ought tohave known better--appeared before the young shepherd in all thesimplicity of immortal costume, in order that he might decide which ofthem was “the fairest.” Each tried to bribe him to adjudge the prize toherself. The Queen of Heaven offered him power in the future; Minerva,wisdom; Venus, the loveliest woman upon earth. Paris chose the last. Itwas Helen; for Venus took it very little into her account that she had ahusband already. It involved also, according to the most picturesque ofthe legends, a somewhat similar breach of troth on Paris’s part. In thevalleys of Ida he had already won the love of the nymph Œnone, but hedeserts her without scruple under the new temptation.[5] He has learntthe secret of his royal birth, and is acknowledged by his father Priam.In spite of the warnings of his sister Cassandra, who has a gift ofprophecy, and foresees evil from the expedition; in spite, too, of theforsaken Œnone’s wild denunciations, he fits out ships and sets sail forGreece. Admitted as a guest to the hospitable court of Menelaus atSparta, he charms both him and Helen by his many accomplishments. Theking, gallant and unsuspicious, and of somewhat easy temperament, asappears from several passages of Homer, leaves him still an inmate ofhis palace, while he himself makes a voyage to Crete. In the husband’sabsence, Paris succeeds--not without some degree of violence, accordingto some of the legends--in carrying off the wife, loading his ships atthe same time (to give emphatic baseness to the exploit) with a richfreight of gold and treasures, the spoils of his absent host. So Venus’spromise is made good, and Priam weakly receives into his palace thefatal beauty who is to prove the ruin of the Trojan fortunes.The outrage rouses all Greece to arms. Menelaus appeals to his brotherAgamemnon, king of Argos and Mycenæ, who held some sort of suzeraintyover the whole of Greece. The brother-kings were the sons of Atreus, ofthe great house of Pelops, who gave his name to the peninsula known asthe Peloponnesus, and now the Morea. It was a house eminent for wealthand splendour and influence. According to an old proverb, valour andwisdom were given by the gods to other names in larger measure, butwealth and power belonged of divine right to the Atridæ. This power mustnot be hastily pronounced fabulous. There yet remain traces of the muraland sepulchral architecture of Agamemnon’s capital, Mycenæ, which arestrongly significant of a pre-historical civilisation--an “iron age” ofmassive strength and no mean resources.[6] Agamemnon, in Homer’s poem,carries a sceptre which had literally, not metaphorically, come down tohim as an heirloom from the king of the gods. Vulcan himself hadwrought it for Jupiter; Jupiter had given it to Hermes, Hermes toPelops, and so it had been handed on. It was in some sort the prototypeof those more than mortal weapons wielded by the heroes of medievalromance, which were one secret of their invincible prowess, and whichhad come from the hand of no human armourer; like the sword Durentaille,which belonged to Charlemagne, and was by him given to his nephewRoland; like Arthur’s Excalibur; or the marvellous blade Recuite, whichpassed from the hands of Alexander the Great to Ptolemy, from Ptolemy toJudas Maccabæus, and so, through many intermediate owners, to theEmperor Vespasian. To the monarchs of the house of Pelops, then,belonged in uncommon degree “the divinity that doth hedge a king;” andAgamemnon is recognised, throughout the whole of the Homeric story, aspre-eminently “King of Men.” But a terrible curse rested on the house--acurse connected with a revolting legend, which, as not recognised byHomer, needs no further notice here, but which was to find amplefulfilment in the sequel of Agamemnon’s history.The royal sons of Atreus take hasty counsel with such of theneighbouring kings and chiefs as they can collect, how they may avengethe wrong. One legend tells us that Tyndarus, the reputed father ofHelen, before he gave her in marriage to Menelaus, had pledged all hersuitors, among whom were the noblest names of Greece, to avenge any suchattempt against the honour of the husband he should choose for her,whichever of them he might be: and that they now redeemed that pledgewhen called upon by the king of Sparta. Nestor, king of Pylos, and achief named Palamedes, went through the coasts of Greece, denouncingthe perfidy of the foreign adventurer, and rousing the national feelingof the Greeks, or, as Homer prefers to call them, the Achæans. Thechiefs did not all obey the summons willingly. Odysseus--better known tous under the Latin form of his name as Ulysses--king of the rocky islandof Ithaca, feigned madness to escape from his engagement. But the shrewdPalamedes detected the imposture. He went to the field where the king,after the simple fashion of the times, was ploughing, carrying with himfrom the house his infant child Telemachus, and laid him down in thefurrow which Ulysses was moodily driving, apparently insensible to allother sights and sounds. The father turned the plough aside, and hisassumed madness was at once detected. In some cases, where there wereseveral sons of military age in the same family, lots were cast for theunwelcome honour of serving against Troy. Some even sent bribes toAgamemnon to induce him to set them free from their engagement.Echepolus of Sicyon, loath to leave his vast possessions, sent to thegreat king his celebrated mare Œthe, the fleetest of her kind, as hispersonal ransom. The bribe was accepted, and Œthe went to Troy insteadof her luxurious master. The story has been adduced in proof ofAgamemnon’s greediness in thus preferring private gain to the publicinterests: but no less a critic than Aristotle has sagaciously observed,that a good horse was a far more valuable conscript than an unwillingsoldier. Some heroes, on the other hand, went resolutely to the war,though the fates foretold that they should never return from it alive.Euchenor of Corinth, though rich like Echepolus, could not be persuadedto remain at home, even when his aged father, who was a seer himself,forewarned him of his doom; he boldly dared his fate, and fell at theclose of the siege by the hand of Paris.Under somewhat similar auguries the great hero of Homer’s tale left hishome for Troy. Achilles, said the legends, was the son of theocean-goddess Thetis by a mortal lover, Peleus son of Æacus. The godshad honoured the marriage with their personal presence--    “For in that elder time, when truth and worth     Were still revered and cherished here on earth,     The tenants of the skies would oft descend     To heroes’ spotless homes, as friend to friend;     There meet them face to face, and freely share     In all that stirred the hearts of mortals there.”[7]The Roman poet Catullus tells us in the same beautiful ode, how mortalsand immortals alike brought their wedding gifts: Chiron the centaur(“that divine beast,” as Pindar calls him) comes from the mountainsladen with coronals of flowers for the banquet, and Peneus, theThessalian river-god, brings whole trees of beech and bay and cypress toshade the guests. Even the three weird sisters, the inexorable Fates,tune their voices for this once into a nuptial hymn, and while theirspindles “run and weave the threads of doom,” they chant the futureglories of the child that shall be born from this auspicious union.Neptune presents the fortunate bridegroom with two horses of divinebreed--Xanthus and Balius--and Chiron gives him a wondrous ashen spear.Both these gifts passed afterwards as heirlooms to Achilles, theoffspring of this marriage, and were carried by him to Troy.Achilles is the very model of a hero, such as heroes would be accountedin times when the softer and nobler qualities of true heroism wereunknown. Strong and beautiful in person, as a goddess-born should be;haughty, and prompt to resent insult, but gallant and generous;passionate alike in his love and in his hate; a stanch friend, and abitter enemy. He is the prototype of Sir Lancelot in many points--“thegoodliest person that ever came among press of knights--the truestfriend to his lover that ever bestrod horse--the sternest man to hismortal foe that ever put spear in rest.” The epithet which Homer himselfgives him is precisely that which was given to the English king who washeld to be the flower of chivalry--“Lionheart.” Though in personalstrength and speed of foot he excels all the other heroes of theexpedition, yet he is not a mere fighter, like his comrade Ajax, but hasall the finer tastes and accomplishments of an age which, however fierceand barbarous in many respects, shows yet a high degree of civilisation.Music and song beguile for him the intervals of battle, and, whetherindignant, sarcastic, or pathetic, he is always an admirable speaker.There is something of a melancholy interest about him, too, notinappropriate to a hero of romance, which the poet never allows us toforget. He has come to Troy with his doom upon him, and he knows it. Hisgoddess-mother has told him that there is a twofold destiny possible forhim: either to live in wealth and peace, and such happiness as they canbring, a long life of inglorious ease in his native land of Phthia, orto embrace in foreign warfare a brief career of victory, a warrior’sdeath, and undying glory. He makes his choice as a hero should--    “One crowded hour of glorious life     Is worth an age without a name.”One fable runs that his mother, Thetis, dipped him when an infant in theriver Styx, which made him invulnerable in every point except the heel,by which she held him:[8] but there is no mention of this in the Iliad,and he goes into battle, for all that appears, as liable to wounds anddeath as any other mortal warrior, and with a presentiment that the lastawaits him before the capture of Troy is complete.At length the ten years’ preparations were all completed. The harbour ofAulis on the coast of Bœotia was the place fixed for the rendezvous.From every quarter where the great race of the Achæans hadsettled,--from the wooded valleys of Thessaly, from all the coasts ofthe Peloponnesus, and the neighbouring islands, from Ithaca andCephallenia on the west to Crete and Rhodes on the east--the chiefs andtheir following were gathered. A hundred ships--long half-deckedrow-galleys, whose average complement was about eighty men--were mannedfrom Agamemnon’s own kingdom of Mycenæ, and he supplied also sixty moreto carry the contingent of the Arcadians, who, as an inland people, hadno fleet of their own. His brother Menelaus brought sixty; Nestor ofPylos, ninety; Idomeneus of Crete, and Diomed of Argos, eighty each.Ulysses and Ajax did but contribute each twelve galleys; but the leaderswere a host in themselves. In all there were twelve hundred vessels,carrying above 100,000 men. With the exception of the chiefs and two orthree officials attached to each galley, such as the helmsman and thesteward, all on board were rowers when at sea, and fighting-men on land.The expedition has been well termed a secular crusade. It wasundertaken, as modern politicians would say, “for an idea;” not forconquest, but for a point of honour. It might be questioned, indeed, howfar the object was worth the cost. There was at least one of theneighbouring kings who at the time took a very unromantic andutilitarian view of the matter. Poltis, king of Thrace, was applied toamongst the rest for his assistance. He inquired into the cause of theexpedition; and when he heard it, he suggested an arrangement whichmight accommodate all differences without the necessity of an appeal toarms. “It is hard,” he said, “for Menelaus to lose a wife: yet veryprobably Paris wanted one. Now I have two wives, whom I can well spare;I will send one to Menelaus, and the other to Paris; and so all partieswill be satisfied.” But we might have lost the Iliad if his counsel hadbeen taken.The great host set sail; but the first time, says the legend, theymissed their way. They mistook a part of the coast called Teuthrania forthe plains of Troy; and then, re-embarking, were driven by a storm backto the shores of Greece. A second time they made their rendezvous atAulis; but Agamemnon had incurred the anger of Diana, and the fleet laywind-bound for many weeks. It was then that deed of purest tragedy wasdone, which, though it forms no part of Homer’s story, has been so oftenthe subject of song, of painting, and of sculpture, and has received somany illustrations in modern literature, that it must find place here.The king is informed by the oracle that the wrath of Heaven can only beappeased by the sacrifice of his virgin daughter Iphianassa, or as sheis more commonly called, Iphigenia. Reluctantly, and only after a bitterstruggle with his feelings, urged by the importunate clamour of thewhole army, and in obedience to his conception of his duties as theirchief, the father consented. The story is immortalised by the anecdotetold of Timanthes, the painter of Sicyon, when competing with a rival ina picture of the sacrifice. The point of admitted difficulty with boththe competitors was to portray the agony in the father’s features at themoment when the sacrificing priest was about to strike the fatal blow.The great artist represented the king as wrapping his face in the foldsof his mantle, and was at once pronounced the winner of the prize. MrTennyson--never more successful than when he draws his inspiration fromthe old classical sources--has made tasteful use of both legend andanecdote in his ‘Dream of Fair Women.’ It is Iphigenia who speaks:--    “I was cut off from hope in that sad place,       Which yet to name my spirit loathes and fears:     My father held his hand upon his face;       I, blinded with my tears,    “Still strove to speak: my voice was thick with sighs,       As in a dream. Dimly I could descry     The stern black-bearded kings with wolfish eyes,       Waiting to see me die.    “The tall masts quivered as they lay afloat,       The temples and the people and the shore;     One drew a sharp knife through my tender throat,       Slowly,--and nothing more.”There was, however, a less harrowing version of the legend. As in theparallel case of Jephtha’s daughter, there were found interpreters whocould not bear that the sacrifice should be carried out. They said thatin mercy Diana substituted a fawn, and carried off the maiden to serveher as a priestess in perpetual maidenhood at her shrine in the TauricChersonese. It is this version of the tale which the Greek tragedianEuripides has followed in his “Iphigenia in Aulis.” Racine, in histragedy, avails himself of a third version of the catastrophe. Thevictim whom Calchas’ oracle demands must be a princess of the blood ofHelen. This Agamemnon’s daughter was--her mother Clytemnestra beingHelen’s sister. But at the last moment another Iphigenia is found,offspring of a previous secret marriage of Helen with Theseus. TheFrench tragedian, following Euripides in representing the princess aspromised in marriage to Achilles, has given the necessary amount ofromance to the _denouement_ by introducing the hero as an impetuouslover of the modern type, surrounding the altar with his faithfulMyrmidons, and vowing that Calchas himself shall be the firstvictim--until the old soothsayer hits upon the expedient of asatisfactory substitute.The wrath of Diana is appeased, the favouring gales are granted, andonce more the Greek armament sets sail. They break their voyage at theisland of Tenedos; and from thence Menelaus, accompanied by Ulysses, whois the diplomatist of the army, proceeds to Troy to make a final demandfor reparation. Even now, if the Trojans will give back Helen and thetreasures, the Greeks will be satisfied. But the terms were rejected,though the reception of the embassy at Troy seems to mark a high stateof civilisation. So the expedition proceeds: but before they make goodtheir landing on the Trojan coast, the Fates demand another victim. Theoracle had said that the first who set foot on Trojan soil must fall.There was a hesitation even among the bravest of the Greeks, and theTrojans and their allies were lining the shore. Protesilaus of Phylacè,with a gallant disregard of omens, leapt to land, and fell, first of hiscountrymen, by a Dardanian spear--launched, as one legend has it, by thenoble hand of Hector. Homer has a pathetic touch in his mention ofhim:--    “Unfinished his proud palaces remain,     And his sad consort beats her breast in vain.”On this slight foundation the Roman poet, Ovid, has constructed one ofthe sweetest of his imaginary ‘Epistles’--that of the wife Laodamia tothe husband of whom she complains as sending no message home, undreamingthat he had long since found a grave on the soil of Troy. A later legendtells us that she wearied the gods with prayers and tears, by night andday, to obtain permission to see her husband once again on earth. Theboon was granted: for the space of three hours the dead hero was allowedto revisit his home, and Laodamia died in his embrace. There is a poeticsequel to the tradition, preserved by Pliny,[9] and thus beautifullyrendered in the concluding lines of Wordsworth’s ‘Laodamia:’--                          “Upon the side    Of Hellespont (such faith was entertained)    A knot of spiry trees for ages grew    From out the tomb of him for whom she died;    And ever, when such stature they had gained    That Ilium’s walls were subject to their view,    The trees’ tall summits withered at the sight--    A constant interchange of growth and blight!”The Trojans, too, had their allies, who came to their aid, when theinvasion was imminent, from the neighbouring tribes of Mysia, Caria,Phrygia, and even the coast towns of Thrace. The most renowned of theseauxiliary chiefs were Sarpedon, who led the Lycian troops, and Æneas,commander of the Dardanians. Both claimed an immortal descent: Æneas wasthe son of Venus by a human lover, Anchises, and sprung from a branch ofthe royal house of Troy: Sarpedon’s father was no less than Jupiterhimself. Next after Hector, the most warlike, but not the eldest of thesons of Priam, these are the most illustrious names on the side of theTrojans in Homer’s story. But the force of the invaders was too strongto allow their adversaries to keep the open field. Soon they were driveninside the walls of the city, while the Greeks ravaged all theneighbouring coast almost unopposed, and maintained themselves at theenemy’s cost. Then began the weary siege which wasted the hopes andresources of both armies for ten long years. To the long night-watchesround the camp-fires of the Greeks we are indebted--so the legendssay--for at least one invention which has enlivened many a waste hoursince, and also, it perhaps may be said, has wasted some hours for itsmore enthusiastic admirers. Palamedes, to cheer the nagging spirits ofhis countrymen, invented for them, among other pastimes, the noblergame of chess; and kings and castles, knights and pawns, still move inillustration of the greater game which was then being played on theplains of Troy. The inventor met with but an ungrateful return,according to one gloomy legend--which, however, is not Homer’s. Ulysseshad never forgiven him the detection of the pretence of madness by whichhe had sought himself to escape the service; nor could he bear so closea rival in what he considered his own exclusive field of subtlety andstratagem. He took the occasion of a fishing expedition to plunge theunfortunate chief overboard.So much of preface seems almost necessary to enable any reader to whomthe Greek mythology is not already familiar ground, to take up Homer’stale with some such previous acquaintance with the subject as the bardhimself would have given him credit for. The want of it has sometimesmade the study of the Iliad less interesting and less intelligent thanit should have been, even to those who have approached it with someknowledge of the original language.       *       *       *       *       *The galleys of the Greeks, when they reached the Trojan coast, were alldrawn up on shore, as was their invariable custom at the end of avoyage, and kept in an upright position by wooden shores. The crews,with the exception of some two or three “ship-keepers” for each galley,disembarked, and formed some kind of encampment near their respectivevessels. Achilles’ station was on one wing, and that of Ajax on theother; these points of danger being assigned to the leaders of highestrepute for valour. The chiefs fought in war-chariots of very lightconstruction, on two wheels and open at the back. These were drawn bytwo--or sometimes three--horses, and carried two persons, both standing;the fighter, armed with sword and shield, and one or two long spearswhich were usually hurled at the enemy--and his charioteer, usually afriend of nearly equal rank. The fighters in most cases dismounted fromtheir chariots when they came to close quarters, their charioteersattending on their movements. The combatants of lower degree fought onfoot. There is no mention of cavalry.THE ILIAD.CHAPTER I.THE QUARREL OF AGAMEMNON AND ACHILLES.Adopting for himself a method which has since become a rule of art, moreor less acknowledged in the literature of fiction, the poet dashes offat once into the full action of his story. He does not ask his readersor hearers to accompany the great armament over sea from the shores ofGreece, or give them the history of the long and weary siege. He plungesat one leap into the tenth year of the war. He assumes from the outset,on the part of those to whom he speaks, a general knowledge of the mainplot of his poem, and of the characters represented: just as the modernauthor of a novel or a poem on the Civil Wars of England would assumesome general acquaintance with the history of Charles I., the characterof Cromwell, and the breach between King and Commons. Nine whole yearsare supposed to have already passed in desultory warfare; but for thedetails of these campaigns the modern reader has to go to other sources,with which also the original hearers are supposed to have beenacquainted. The Trojans and their allies are cooped up within the wallsof their city, while the Greek hero Achilles has spread the terror ofhis name far and wide.The poet’s exordium is of the very briefest. His invocation to thegoddess of song is in just three words:--    “Sing, heavenly muse, the wrath of Peleus’ son.”We have here the key-note of the poem brought before us in the veryfirst line--nay, in the very first word, according to the original, for“wrath” stands first in the Greek, which it cannot very conveniently doin the English. The two great heroes of the Greek chivalry, Agamemnonand Achilles, always jealous of each other, come to an open quarrel infull council of the princes of the League. Their quarrel is--like theoriginal cause of the war, like so many quarrels before and since--abouta woman, a beautiful captive. A fatal pestilence is raging in the camp.The Sun-god, Apollo, is angry. To him and to his twin-sister Diana, theMoon, all mysterious diseases were attributed--not without somesufficient reasons, in a hot climate. Pestilence and disease were thearrows of Apollo and Diana. Therefore the Greeks have no doubt as to theauthor of the present calamity. It is “the god of the silver bow” who issending his swift shafts of death amongst them. The poet’s vision evensees the dread Archer in bodily shape. It is a fine picture; the Englishreader will lose little of its beauty in Lord Derby’s version:--    “Along Olympus’ heights he passed, his heart     Burning with wrath; behind his shoulders hung     His bow and ample quiver; at his back     Rattled the fateful arrows as he moved.     Like the night-cloud he passed, and from afar     He bent against the ships, and sped the bolt;     And fierce and deadly twanged the silver bow.     First on the mules and dogs, on man the last,     Was poured the arrowy storm; and through the camp     Constant and numerous blazed the funeral-fires.”In their misery the Greeks appeal to their soothsayer Calchas, to divinefor them the cause of the god’s displeasure. The Mantis or soothsayer,whose skill was in most cases supposed to be hereditary, accompanied aGreek force on all its expeditions; and no prudent general would risk abattle, or engage in any important enterprise, without firstascertaining from this authority the will of the gods, as shadowed outin certain appearances of the sacrifice, or some peculiarity in theflight of birds, or some phenomena of the heavens. In this particularexpedition it would appear that Calchas had turned the last branch ofhis art to good purpose; it must have been his knowledge of the starswhich had enabled him, as Homer tells us, to pilot the great fleet fromtheir own shores to Troy. He confesses that he can read the secret ofApollo’s present wrath; but he hesitates to tell it, dreading, he says,lest he should thereby anger the “great chief whom the whole hostobeys.” Achilles charges him to speak out boldly without fear or favour;none shall harm him--not even if he should denounce Agamemnon himself asthe cause of this visitation, adds the hero, gladly seizing theopportunity of hurling a defiance at his great rival. Thus supported,the seer speaks out; Agamemnon is indeed the guilty cause. In a lateforay he had taken captive the maiden daughter of Chryses, a priest ofthe Sun-god, and the father had come to the camp of the invaders as asuppliant, pleading the sanctity of his office, and offering a fittingransom. The great king had refused to listen, had sent him away withbitter words and threats; and the priest had prayed to his god to punishthe insult: hence the pestilence. Immediately the popularvoice--expressed loudly through Achilles--demands the maiden’s instantrestitution to her father. Agamemnon, though burning with indignationalike against the seer and his champion, dares not refuse. Hisprerogative, however generally admitted and respected by the confederatearmy, is dependent in such extremities on the popular will. He promisesat once to send back the daughter of Chryses unharmed and withoutransom. But at the same time, after a stormy and bitter dispute withAchilles, he announces his intention to insist on that chief resigning,by way of exchange, a fair captive named Briseis, carried off in somesimilar raid, who had been awarded to him as his share of the publicspoil. To this insolent demand the majority of the council of chiefs,content with their victory on the main question, appear to raise noobjection. But Achilles--his impetuous nature roused to madness by thestudied insult--leaps up and half unsheathes his sword. Even then--suchis the Greek’s reverence for authority--he hesitates; and as he standswith his hand upon the hilt, there sweeps down from Olympus[10] PallasAthene (Minerva), the goddess of wisdom, sent by Here (Juno) Queen ofHeaven to check this fatal strife between her favourite Greeks. Thecelestial messenger is visible to Achilles alone. She calms the hero’swrath so far as to restrain him from any act of violence; but, as shedisappears, he turns on his enemy, and swears a mighty oath--the royaloath of kings--by the golden-studded staff, or “sceptre,” which wasborne by king, priest, and judge as the emblem of their authority.Pope’s rendering has all the fire of the original, and the additionaltouches which he throws in are at least in a kindred spirit:--    “By this I swear, when bleeding Greece again     Shall call Achilles, she shall call in vain:     When flushed with slaughter Hector comes to spread     The purpled shore with mountains of the dead,     Then shalt thou mourn th’ affront thy madness gave,     Forced to deplore, when impotent to save;     Then rage in bitterness of soul, to know     This act has made the bravest Greek thy foe.”He dashes his sceptre on the ground, and sits down in savage silence.Agamemnon is ready enough to return the taunt, when there rises in theassembly a venerable figure, whose grey hairs and tried sagacity incouncil command at once the respect of all. It is Nestor, thehoary-headed chieftain of the rocky Pylos in the Peloponnese--known inhis more vigorous days as “the horse-tamer,” and, in sooth, not a littleproud of his past exploits. Two generations of men he has alreadyoutlived in his own dominions, and is now loved and respected by thethird. He has joined the great armament still sound in wind and limb;but he is valued now not so much for his    “Red hand in the foray,”as for his    “Sage counsel in cumber.”He can clothe this counsel, too, in winning words. The stream ofeloquence that flowed from his lips, says the poet, was “sweeter thanhoney.” He gently reproves both disputants for their unseemly strife--ashame to the Greeks, a triumph to the enemy. His words ring like thelament of David over the suicide of Saul--“Tell it not in Gath, publishit not in the streets of Askelon, lest the daughters of the Philistinesrejoice.”    “Alas, deep sorrow on our land doth fall!     Yet shall on Priam and his sons alight     Hope, and a great joy on the Trojans all,     Hearing ye waste in bitter feud your might,     Ye twain, our best in counsel and in fight.” (W.)He proceeds to tell them something of his own long experience, by way ofclaim on their attention--with something also, as critics have noticed,of an old man’s garrulity. But the reader, it should be remembered,really wants to know something about him, even if the Greeks may havebeen supposed to have heard his story before.                          “In times past    I lived with men--and they despised me not--    Abler in counsel, greater than yourselves.    Such men I never saw and ne’er shall see,    As Pirithous and Dryas, wise and brave,    And Theseus, Œgeus’ more than mortal son.    The mightiest they among the sons of men,    The mightiest they, and of the forest beasts    Strove with the mightiest, and their rage subdued.    With them I played my part; with them, not one    Would dare to fight of mortals now on earth.    Yet they my counsels heard, my voice obeyed;    And hear ye also--for my words are wise.” (D.)The angry chiefs do hear him so far, that after the interchange of a fewmore passionate words they leave the council. Achilles stalks offgloomily to his tent, accompanied by his faithful friend and henchman,Patroclus (of whom we shall hear more), and followed by his retinue.Agamemnon proceeds at once to carry out his resolution. He despatches agalley with a trusty crew, under the command of the sage Ulysses, to theisland of Chrysa, to restore the old priest’s daughter to him in allhonour, with expiatory presents, and the offer of a hecatomb to theSun-god. They make the voyage quickly, and arrive safely at the island.The rapid movement here of Homer’s verse has rarely been more happilyrendered than in the English hexameters of Mr Landon:--    “Out were the anchors cast, and the ropes made fast to the steerage;     Out did the sailors leap on the foaming beach of the ocean;     Out was the hecatomb led for the skilful marksman Apollo;     Out Chryseis arose from the ship that sped through the waters.”So, by the good priest’s prayers, the god is propitiated, and the plaguein the Greek host is stayed.Meanwhile another embassy, on a very different errand, has beendespatched by the King of Men to the tents where Achilles lies, hard byhis ships, with his fierce bands of Myrmidons encamped around him. Theirname has passed into a by-word, being commonly but incorrectly used todesignate an unscrupulous rabble of followers, to whom their leader’sword is law. The notion must be derived not from Homer, but from Pope.In his version of the quarrel between Agamemnon and Achilles, he makesthe former say to his antagonist--    “Go, threat thine earth-born Myrmidons; but here     ’Tis mine to threaten, prince, and thine to fear.”But to suppose that the Myrmidons were subservient to any man’s threats,is to give them a very different character from what we find in Homer.Even the epithet “earth-born,” which is Pope’s, not Homer’s, and whichmay easily be misunderstood, they would have prized as a highcompliment, implying that they were no new race, but the aboriginalpossessors of their native soil; just as the proud Athenians wore the“golden grasshopper” in their hair, because that insect was fabled toowe its birth to the spontaneous action of the earth. The followers ofAchilles were indeed “fierce as ravening wolves,” as the poet hasafterwards described them; but they were the very flower of the Greekarmy, troops of whom any leader might be proud, and if they had awolfish thirst for blood, they were no worse and no better in thisrespect than Achilles himself, or any captain in the host before Troy;for an insatiable ferocity, when once the spirit of combativeness isaroused, is the characteristic of all Homer’s heroes, as in those of themedieval romances.The purpose of the king’s embassy to Achilles is, of course, inpursuance of his threat, to demand the surrender of the fair Briseis.Such a message to such a man is no very safe or agreeable errand. ButAgamemnon chooses his envoys well. He sends two heralds--Eurybates andTalthybius. The herald’s office, in early Greek warfare, had an especialsanctity. Those who held it were not mere officials whose name protectedthem, but men of noble and even of royal birth, who might have beencaptains of thousands themselves, if they had not chosen, as it were,the civilian’s place in warfare. Such diplomacy as there was room forin those ages was transacted by them. They were under the specialprotection of Zeus, as the god of oaths and treaties. There was no fearthat the noble chief of the Myrmidons, even in his most furious mood,would treat such envoys rudely. But in fact his reception of them is oneof the most remarkable scenes in the poem, both from its high-tonedcourtesy and from its strong contrast with the hero’s previous bearingtowards Agamemnon. Achilles receives the heralds of the king much as awell-bred gentleman of fifty years ago would have received the “friend”who carried a hostile message from one with whom he had a deadly quarrela few hours before. The demand which they brought from Agamemnon waspointed with the additional threat that, if he refused to give up thedamsel, the king would come himself and carry her off by the stronghand,--a threat almost brutal, because quite unwarranted; since Achilleshad declared in the council that if the Greeks, who had awarded her ashis battle-prize, chose to acquiesce in the injustice of demanding herback from him, _he_ should make no resistance. But it does not seem thatthe heralds delivered themselves of the additional insult which theywere charged to convey. They had no need. As they stand at the entranceof his tent, “troubled and awe-stricken,” loath to begin their unwelcometale, Achilles sets them at their ease at once in a few calm anddignified words. He recognises in them “the messengers of Zeus”--and ifnow by accident of Agamemnon, the offence is his, not theirs. He at oncebids Patroclus lead forth the damsel, and gives her into their custody,to deal with according to their orders. He repeats his oath, however,though in calmer terms; and calls them to witness before heaven thatAgamemnon, in his day of need, shall look in vain for the saving arm ofthe man he has insulted.It is something in favour of a tender side to the hero’s character, thatthe “fair-cheeked” Briseis, spoil of war though she was, parts from himvery reluctantly. Achilles, for his share, fairly weeps: but not themost romantic reader of the story dares nurse the idea that it is forhis Briseis. They who bring with them, to the pages of classicalfiction, a taste which has been built up by modern song and romance,must be warned at once that there is no love-story in either Iliad orOdyssey. Indeed, one remarkable point of difference between theimaginative writers of antiquity and those of our own days, lies in theabsence of that which is the motive and the key-note of five-sixths ofour modern tales in prose and verse. Love between unmarried persons, inthe sense in which we commonly use the word, seems very much the productof modern civilisation. There is indeed a passion which we name by thesame English word--the mere animal passion, which Homer, to do himjustice, deals with but as a matter of fact, and never paints inattractive colours. There is again a love of another kind--the love ofthe husband for his wife and of the wife for her husband--which the oldpoet also well understood, and which furnishes him with scenes of thehighest pathos and beauty. But as to the sentiment which forms thecommon staple of modern romance and drama, Homer certainly did not knowwhat it meant, nor Achilles or Briseis either. As for the latter, if sheshed tears, it was no doubt because she had found in Achilles a kindand generous lord and master, who had made her captive lot (which mightchance to come to the turn of any lady or princess in those warliketimes) as tolerable as such a life could be; and because Agamemnon--ifshe had heard his character from Achilles--did not promise a veryfavourable change in that respect.Achilles weeps--but not for Briseis. He is touched in a point where heis far more sensitive--his honour. He has been robbed of the guerdon ofvalour, bestowed on him in full conclave of the chiefs of the army. Hehas been robbed of it by Agamemnon--the man for whose especial sake, toavenge whose family wrongs, he has come on this long expedition from hishome. This was his indignant protest in their dispute at the council--    “Well dost thou know that ’twas no feud of mine     With Troy’s brave sons, that brought me here in arms;     They never did me wrong; they never drove     My cattle, or my horses; never sought     In Phthia’s fertile life-sustaining fields     To waste the crops; for wide between us lay     The shadowy mountains and the roaring sea.     With thee, O void of shame! with thee we sailed,     For Menelaüs and for thee, ingrate,     Glory and fame on Trojan crests to win.” (D.)And now this is his reward! And the whole Greek army, too, have madethemselves partakers in the wrong, inasmuch as they have tamely lookedon, and allowed the haughty king thus to override honour, gratitude, andjustice. His indignation is intense. He wanders away, and sits alone onthe sea-beach, “gazing vacantly on the illimitable ocean.” Soon therecomes a change upon his spirit; and now, with a childlikepetulance--these Homeric heroes, with all their fierce ways, are stillso very childlike, and therefore so human and so interesting--he criesto his mother. True, that mother is, as we remember, a goddess--Thetis,daughter of the great Jupiter, and of potent influence in the watersbeneath the earth. To her he bemoans himself. That his days were to befew, he knew when he came here to Troy; but she had promised him undyingrenown. It has failed him: his “one crowded hour of glorious life” isdarkened in dishonour. He cries, and his goddess-mother hears him--    “Beside her aged father where she sat,     In the deep ocean-caves.”It is the original of our own Milton’s beautiful invocation inComus--the rough simple outline on which he has painted with a grace andfulness which make it all his own--    “Sabrina fair!       Listen, where thou art sitting     Under the glassy, cool, translucent wave,       In twisted braids of lilies knitting     The loose train of thy amber-dropping hair;       Listen for dear honour’s sake,       Goddess of the silver lake,                 Listen, and save!”Thetis hears, and rises on the sea--“like as it were a mist”--(the“White Lady of Avenel”) caresses him soothingly with her hand, as thoughthe stalwart warrior were still a child indeed, and asks him the simplequestion which all mothers, goddesses or not, would put into much thesame words--“My son, why weepest thou?” He tells his tale of wrong; andshe proceeds to give him, in the first place, advice certainly not wiserthan that of some earthly mothers. She does not advise him to make uphis quarrel with Agamemnon, but to nurse his wrath, and withdrawhimself wholly from the siege. She, meanwhile, will intercede withJupiter, and beseech him to grant the Trojans victory for a while, thatso the Greeks may learn to feel the loss of the hero whom they haveinsulted.There is an obstacle, however, in the way of the immediate performanceof her promise--a ludicrous obstacle, to our modern taste, though thepoet does not so intend it. The King of the Gods has gone out todinner--or rather to a continuous festival of twelve days, to which hehas been invited by “the blameless Ethiopians;”[11] a race with whom theImmortals of Olympus have some mysterious connection, which has beenheld to imply an Eastern origin for the Greek religion and race. Withthe dawn of the twelfth morning, however, Thetis presents herself in the“brazen-floored” halls of Jupiter, and we are introduced to the Olympiancourt and household. A strange picture it is--such a travesty of adivine life as makes us wonder what the poet himself really conceived ofthe gods of his adoption. The life of mortal heroes in the world belowis grandeur and nobleness itself compared with that of the Olympianheaven. Its pleasures indeed are much the same--those of sensualgratification; the feast, the wine-cup, music and song, are what godsand goddesses delight in as much as those whom the poet patheticallycalls “the creatures of a day.” But all their passions are incomparablymeaner. The wrath of Achilles is dignified--Juno’s anger against Troyis mere vicious spite. The subtle craft of Ulysses is at least exercisedfor the benefit of his countrymen and their cause; but the shiftycounsels of Jupiter are the mere expedients of a cunning despot who,between queen and ministers and favourites, finds it difficult, in spiteof his despotism, to have his own way. The quarrel between Agamemnon andAchilles is tragedy: the domestic wrangles of the Thunderer and hisqueen are in the very spirit of low comedy, and not even the burlesquesof Life in Olympus, which some years ago were popular on our Englishstage, went far beyond the recognised legends of mythology. In fact, thecomic element, what little there is of it in the Iliad, is supplied(with the single exception of the incident of Thersites) by the powerswhom the poet recognises as divinities. The idea of rival wills andinfluences existing in the supernatural world led the poet necessarilyto represent his gods as quarrelling; and quarrels in a primitive ageare perhaps hardly compatible with dignity. But the conception of godsin human shape has always a tendency to monstrosities and caricature.How close, too, the supernatural and the grotesque seem to lie togethermay be seen even in the existing sculptures and carvings of ancientChristendom, and still more remarkably in the old Miracle-Plays, whichmix buffoonery with the most sacred subjects in a manner which it ishard to reconcile with any real feeling of reverence.Thetis throws herself at the feet of her father Jupiter, and begs ofhim, as a personal favour, the temporary humiliation of Agamemnon andhis Greeks. For a while the Thunderer is silent, and hesitates; Thetisperseveringly clings to his knees. At last he confides to her his dreadlest a compliance with her petition should involve him in domesticdifficulties.    “Sad work thou mak’st, in bidding me oppose     My will to Juno’s, when her bitter words     Assail me, for full oft amid the gods     She taunts me that I aid the Trojan cause.     But thou return--_that Juno see thee not_--     And leave to me the furtherance of thy suit.” (D.)He pledges his promise to her, and ratifies it with the mighty nod thatshakes Olympus--a solemn confirmation which made his word irrevocable.    “Waved on th’ immortal head th’ ambrosial locks,     And all Olympus trembled at his nod.”Critics have somewhat over-praised the grandeur of the image; but it issaid that the great sculptor Phidias referred to it as having furnishedhim with the idea of his noble statue of Olympian Jove. Satisfied withher success, Thetis plunges down from high Olympus into the sea, and theThunderer proceeds to take his place in full council of the gods, ascalm as if nothing had happened. But there are watchful eyes about himwhich he has not escaped. Juno has been a witness of the interview, andhas a shrewd suspicion of its object. A connubial dialogue ensues,which, though the poet has thought fit to transfer the scene of it toOlympus, is of an exceedingly earthly, and what we should now call“realistic,” type. Homer’s recognised translators have not condescendedto give it the homely tone of the original. Pope is grandiloquent, andLord Derby calmly dignified; but Homer intends to be neither. MrGladstone’s translation comes nearest the spirit of the Greek. Thebrief encounter between the king and queen of the Immortals is cut shortby the former in rather summary fashion. “Thou hast been promisinghonour to Achilles, I trow,” says Juno.    “Zeus that rolls the clouds of heaven her addressing answered then;     ‘Moonstruck! thou art ever _trowing_; never I escape thy ken.     After all, it boots thee nothing; leaves thee of my heart the less:     So thou hast the worser bargain. What if I the fact confess?     It was done because I willed it. Hold thy peace--my word obey,     Lest, if I come near, and on thee these unconquered hands I lay,     All the gods that hold Olympus nought avail thee here to-day.’”[12]He bids her, in very plain Greek, sit down and hold her tongue; andgives her clearly to understand--with a threat of violence which is anunusual addition to his many failings as a husband--that it is his fixedintention, on this occasion, to be lord and master, not only of Olympus,but of his wife. Juno is silenced, and the whole assembly of the gods isstartled by the Thunderer’s violence. Vulcan, the fire-god--the lamebrawny hunchback, always more or less the jester and the butt of thecourt of Olympus, but with more brains in his head than most of hisstraight-limbed compeers--Vulcan comes to the general relief. He sootheshis royal mother by the argument, that it were ill indeed to break thepeace of heaven for the sake of two or three wretched mortals: and hereminds her--we must suppose in an aside--that they both knew by bitterexperience that when the father of gods and men _did_ choose to putforth his might, it went hard with all who resisted.    “When to thy succour once before I came,     He seized me by the foot, and hurled me down     From heaven’s high threshold; all the day I fell,     And with the setting sun on Lemnos’ isle     Lighted, scarce half-alive; there was I found,     And by the Sintian people kindly nursed.” (D.)He gives the mother-goddess further comfort--in “a double cup,” which heproceeds also to hand round the whole of the august circle. They quafftheir nectar with unusual zest, as they break into peals of laughter (itmust be confessed, rather ungratefully) at the hobbling gait and awkwardattentions of their new cup-bearer:--    “Thus they till sunset passed the festive hours;     Nor lacked the banquet aught to please the sense,     Nor sound of tuneful lyre by Phœbus touched,     Nor Muses’ voice, who in alternate strains     Responsive sung; but when the sun had set     Each to his home departed, where for each     The crippled Vulcan, matchless architect,     With wondrous skill a noble house had reared.”And so, at the end of the first book of the poem, the curtain falls onthe Olympian happy family.But Jupiter has but a wakeful night. He is planning how he may bestcarry out his promise to Thetis. He sends a lying spirit in a dream toAgamemnon at midnight. The vision stands at the head of the king’scouch, taking the shape of old Nestor. In this character it encourageshim to muster all his forces to storm the city of Troy on the morrow.Now, at last, the false phantom assures him, its walls are doomed tofall; the strife in heaven is ended; Juno’s counsels have prevailed, andthe fate of Troy is sealed irrevocably.Joyfully the King of Men arises from his sleep, and summons at daybreaka council of the chiefs. Already, says the poet, he storms and sacks theroyal city in imagination, little foreseeing the long and bloodystruggle that lies yet between him and his prey. In the council heinvents a stratagem of his own, which complicates the story considerablywithout improving it. He suspects the temper of his army; and before hemakes up his mind to lead them to the assault, he seeks to ascertainwhether or no the long ten years’ siege has worn out their patience andbroken their spirit. He will try the dangerous experiment of proposingto them to break up the siege and embark at once for home. He himselfwill make the proposal to the whole army; the other leaders, for theirpart, are to oppose such a base retreat, and urge their followers tomake yet another effort for the national honour of Greece.The clans, at the summons of their several chiefs, muster in theirthousands from tents and ships; and Agamemnon, seated on his throne ofstate, the immortal sceptre in his hand, harangues them in accordancewith his preconcerted stratagem. He paints in lively colours theweariness of the nine years’ siege, his own disappointed hopes, thepainful yearning of their long-deserted wives and children for thereturn of their husbands and fathers; and ends by proposing an immediatere-embarkation for home. He plays his part only too successfully. Theimmense host heaves and sways with excitement at his words--“like thelong waves of the Icarian Sea, like the deep tall corn-crop as thesummer wind sweeps over it”--and with tumultuous shouts of exultationthey rush down to their galleys and begin at once to launch them; solittle regard have the multitude for glory, so strong is their yearningfor home. It is possible that the poet is no unconscious satirist, andthat he willingly allowed his hearers to draw, if they pleased, theinference which he hints in more than one passage, that war is the sportof princes, for which the masses pay the cost.But Juno’s ever-watchful eyes have marked the movement. Again Minerva isher messenger, and shoots down from Olympus to stop this disgracefulflight. She addresses herself to the ear of the sage Ulysses, who knowsher voice at once. Wisdom speaks to the wise,--if any reader prefers themoral allegory to the simple fiction. Ulysses is standing fixed indisgust and despair at the cowardice of his countrymen. The goddess bidshim use all his eloquence to check their flight. Without a word heflings off his cloak,[13] and meeting Agamemnon, receives the immortalsceptre from his hand, and armed with this staff of authority rushesdown to the galleys. Any king or chieftain whom he encounters he hastilyreminds of the secret understanding which had been the result of theprevious council, and urges them, at least, to set a braver example. Tothe plebeian crowd he uses argument of another kind. He applies theroyal sceptre to them in one of its primitive uses, as a rod ofcorrection, and bids them wait for orders from their superiors. Easilyswayed to either course, the crowd are awed into quiet by his energeticremonstrances. One popular orator alone lifts his well-known voiceloudly in defiance. It is a certain Thersites, of whom the poet gives asketch, brief enough, but with so many marks of individuality, that wemay be justified in looking at him as a character drawn from life.    “The ugliest man was he who came to Troy,     With squinting eyes and one distorted foot,     His shoulders round, and buried in his breast     His narrow head with scanty growth of hair.”His talent lies in speaking evil of dignities--a talent which, no doubt,he had found popular enough in some circles of camp society, though allthe respectable Greeks, we are assured, are shocked at him. He launchesout now with bitter virulence--in which there is nevertheless (as inmost oratory of the kind) a certain amount of truth--against Agamemnon.He denounces his greed, his selfishness, his disregard of the sufferingsof his troops, his late treatment of Achilles; they must all be cowards,he says, to obey such a leader--    “Women of Greece! I will not call ye men!”Why not sail home at once, and leave him, if he can, to take Troy withhis own single hand?The mutineer speaks in an evil hour for himself, this time; for Ulysseshears him. That energetic chief answers him in terms as strong as hisown, and warns him that if he should catch him again railing in likefashion--“taking the name of kings in his abusive mouth”--he will striphis garments from him, and flog him naked back to the ships. And, as anearnest of his promise, he lays the mighty sceptre heavily on his backand shoulders. Such prompt and vigorous chastisement meets the popularhumour at once; and as the hunchback writhes and howls under the blows,the fickle feelings of the Greeks break forth in peals of laughter. “Ofthe many good things Ulysses has done, this last,” they swear, “is thebest of all.”Then, prompted still by the goddess of Wisdom, Ulysses harangues thereassembled troops. He reminds them of their plighted oath of service toAgamemnon, of the encouraging oracles of heaven, of the disgrace ofreturning home from an unaccomplished errand. With the art of a trueorator, he sympathises with their late feelings--it _is_ bitter for themall, indeed, to waste so many years on a foreign shore, far from home,and wife, and children; but bitterest of all would it be    “Long to remain, and bootless to return.”The venerable Nestor speaks to the same effect; and Agamemnon himselfcloses the debate with a call to immediate battle. It is a right royalspeech, far more worthy of a true “king of men” than his formerphilippics--moderate in his allusion to Achilles, spirited in his appealto his warriors.       “Come but new friendship, and our feud destroy,        Then from the evil that is fixed and sealed        Not one day’s respite shall be left to Troy--        But now to dinner, ere we take the field;        Let each his spear whet, and prepare his shield,        Feed well the horses, and each chariot test,        That we may fight it out till one side yield,        Fight in sound harness, and not think of rest,    Till the black night decide it as to Zeus seems best.       “Then shall the horses in their foam be wet,        While forward in the glittering car they strain;        Then shall the straps of the broad buckler sweat        Round many a breast there battling in the plain;        Then shall the arm droop, hurling spears with pain:        And whomsoever I behold at lair        Here by the ships, and for the fight not fain,        Small for that skulker is the hope, I swear,    But that the dogs he fatten and the fowls of air.” (W.)He remembers, too, like a wise general, that a battle may be lost byfighting on an empty stomach. So the oxen and the fatlings are slain,the choice pieces of the thighs and the fat are offered in sacrifice tothe gods, and then the whole army feasts their fill. Agamemnon holds aselect banquet of six of the chief leaders--King Idomeneus of Crete,Nestor, Ajax the Greater and the Less, and Ulysses, “wise in council asZeus.” One guest comes uninvited--his brother Menelaus. He is nodinner-loving intruder; he comes, as the poet simply tells us, “becausehe knew in his heart how many were his brother’s cares andanxieties,”--he might be of some use or support to him. Throughout thewhole of the poem, the mutual affection borne by these two brothers isvery remarkable, and unlike any type of the same relationship whichexists in fiction. It is never put forward or specially dwelt upon, butcomes out simply and naturally in every particular of their intercourse.A king and priest, like Abraham at Bethel, Agamemnon stands by hisburnt-offering, and lifts his prayer for victory to Jupiter, “mostglorious and most great, who dwells in the clouds and thick darkness.”But no favourable omen comes from heaven. The god, whether or no heaccepts the offering, gives no sign. Nevertheless--we may suppose with acertain wilfulness which is part of his character--Agamemnon proceeds toset the battle in array; and the second book of the Iliad closes withthe long muster-roll of the Greek clans under their respective kings orchiefs on the one side, and of the Trojans and their allies on theother, which in our introduction has already been partlyanticipated.[14] The long list of chiefs, with their genealogies andbirthplaces, and the strength of their several contingents, wasevidently composed with a view to recitation: and whatever may be itsvalue as an authentic record, we can understand the interest with whicha Greek audience would listen to a muster-roll which was to them whatthe Roll of Battle Abbey was to the descendants of the Normans inEngland. If here and there, upon occasion, the wandering minstrelinserted in the text the name and lineage of some provincial hero on hisown responsibility, the popular applause would assuredly be none theless.CHAPTER II.THE DUEL OF PARIS AND MENELAUS.The battle is set in array, “army against army.” But there is adifference in the bearing of the opposed forces which is verysignificant, and is probably a note of real character, not a mere strokeof the poet’s art. The Trojan host, after the fashion of Asiaticwarfare, modern as well as ancient, move forward to the combat with loudshouts and clashing of weapons. The poet compares their confused clamourto the noise of a flock of cranes on their annual migration. The Greeks,on the other hand, march in silence, with closed ranks, uttering nosound, but “breathing determination.” So, when afterwards they actuallyclose for action, not a sound is heard in their ranks but the voice ofthe leaders giving the word of command. “You would not think,” says thepoet, “that all that mighty host had tongues;” while, in the mixedbattalions of the enemy, whose allies are men of many lands andlanguages, there arises a noisy discordant clamour--“like as of bleatingewes that hear the cries of their lambs.”But while the hostile forces yet await the signal for the battle, Parissprings forth alone from the Trojan ranks. “Godlike” he is in hisbeauty, and with the leve of personal adornment which befits hischaracter, he wears a spotted leopard’s hide upon his shoulders.Tennyson’s portrait of him, though in a different scene, is thoroughlyHomeric--                  “White-breasted like a star,    Fronting the dawn he moved; a leopard’s skin    Drooped from his shoulder, but his sunny hair    Clustered about his temples like a god’s.”Advancing with long strides in the space between the armies, hechallenges the leaders of the Greeks, one and all, to meet him singly inmortal combat. Menelaus hears the boast. “Like a hungry lion springingon his prey,” he leaps full-armed from his chariot, exulting in thethought that now at last his personal vengeance shall be gratified. Butconscience makes a coward of Paris. He starts back--“as a man that seesa serpent in his path”--the godlike visage grows pale, the kneestremble, and the Trojan champion draws back under the shelter of hisfriends from the gallant hero whom he has so bitterly wronged. The Romanhistorian Livy--a poet in prose--had surely this passage in his mindwhen he described Sextus Tarquinius, the dishonourer of Lucretia,quailing, as no Roman of his blood and rank would otherwise havequailed, when young Valerius dashes out from the Roman lines to engagehim. The moral teaching of the heathen poet on such points is far higherthan that of the medieval romancers with whom he has so many points incommon. Sir Tristram of Lyonnois has no such scruples of conscience inmeeting King Mark. Lancelot, indeed, will not fight with Arthur; but thevery nobility of character with which the unknown author of thatstriking impersonation has endowed him is in itself the highest of allwrongs against morality, in that it steals the reader’s sympathies forthe wrong-doer instead of for the injured husband. Shakespeare, as ishis wont, strikes the higher key. It is the consciousness of guilt whichmakes Macbeth half quail before Macduff--    “Of all men else have I avoided thee:     But get thee back--my soul is too much charged     With blood of thine already.     ...I will not fight with thee.”Paris withdraws into the Trojan ranks, and there encounters Hector. Ashas been already said, the poet assumes at the outset, on the part ofhis audience, at least such knowledge of his _dramatis personæ_ as tomake a formal introduction unnecessary. Hector is the noblest of all thesons of Priam, the shield and bulwark of his countrymen throughout thelong years of the war. Achilles is the hero of the Iliad, and to himHomer assigns the palm of strength and valour; but, as is not seldom thecase in fiction, the author has painted the rival hero so well that oursympathies are at least as frequently found on his side. We almost shareJuno’s feelings against the Trojans when they are represented by Paris;but when Hector comes into the field, our hearts half go over to theenemy. His character will be touched upon more fully hereafter: for thepresent, it must discover itself in the course of the story. He throwshimself in the way of Paris in his cowardly retreat; and in spite of thefraternal feeling which is so remarkably strong amongst Homer’sheroes,--in Hector and his brothers almost as much as in Agamemnon andMenelaus,--shame and disgust at his present poltroonery now minglethemselves with a righteous hatred of the selfish lust which hasplunged his country into a bloody war--       “Was it for this, or with such heart as now,        O’er the wide billows with a chosen band        Thou sailedst, and with violated vow        Didst bring thy fair wife from the Apian strand,        Torn from the house of men of warlike hand,        And a great sorrow for thy father’s head,        Troy town, and all the people of the land,        By thine inhospitable offence hast bred,    Thus for the enemy’s sport, thine own confusion dread?       “Lo, now thou cowerest, and wilt not abide        Fierce Menelaus--thou hadst known, I ween,        Soon of what man thou hast the blooming bride!        Poor had the profit of thy harp then been,        Vain Aphrodite’s gifts, thy hair, thy mien,        He mangling in the dust thy fallen brow.        But there is no wrong to the Trojans keen,        And they are lambs in Spirit; or else hadst thou    Worn, for thine evil works, a cloke of stone ere now.” W.Paris has the grace to admit the justice of his brother’s rebuke.Hector, he confesses, is far the better soldier; only he pleads, with aself-complacency which he never loses, that grace of person, and asmooth tongue, and a taste for music, are nothing less than the gifts ofthe gods--that, in fact, it is not his fault that he is so irresistible.He ends, however, with an offer which is far more to Hector’s mind. Letopen lists be pitched in sight of both armies, and he will engageMenelaus in single combat; Helen and her wealth shall be the prize ofvictory.It is a proposal at which Hector’s heart rejoices. He checks at once theadvancing line of the Trojans, and steps out himself to the front. TheGreeks bend their bows at him, but Agamemnon understands his motions,and bids them hold their hands. It is a fair challenge which the Trojanprince comes to make on behalf of Paris. Menelaus accepts it, in a fewplain and gallant words--he is no orator:--    “Hear now my answer; in this quarrel I     May claim the chiefest share; and now I hope     Trojans and Greeks may see the final close     Of all the labours ye so long have borne,     T’ avenge my wrong at Paris’ hand sustained.     And of us two whiche’er is doomed to death,     So let him die! the rest depart in peace.” (D.)A truce is agreed upon, to abide the result of this appeal of battle. Amessenger from Olympus--Iris, goddess of the Rainbow--comes to warnHelen of the impending duel. And this introduces one of the mostbeautiful passages in the whole Iliad, to modern taste. Its sentimentand pathos are perfectly level and quiet; but as a natural and life-likeyet highly-wrought portrait of a scene in what we may call the socialdrama, it stands almost without equal or parallel in classicalliterature.Helen--the fatal cause of the war, the object of such violent passionsand such bitter taunts--is sitting pensively in the palace of her royalfather-in-law, writing her own miserable story. She is writing it--notin a three-volumed novel, as a lady who had a private history, more orless creditable, would write it now, but--in a golden tapestry, in whichmore laborious form it was in those days not unfrequent to writesensational biographies. Iris urges her to be present at the show. Thewhole reads like the tale of some medieval tournament, except that Helenherself is the prize of victory as well as the Queen of Beauty. Attendedby her maidens, she goes down to the place where the aged Priam, likethe kings of the Old Testament history, “sits in the gate” surroundedby the elders of his city. It is the “Scæan,” or “left-hand” gate, whichopens towards the camp of the enemy, and commands a view of their lines.We have had no word as yet of the marvellous beauty of Helen. There isno attempt to describe it throughout the whole of the poem. But here, ina few masterly touches, introduced in the simplest and most naturalmanner, Homer does more than describe it, when he tells us its effects.The old men break off their talk as the beautiful stranger draws near.They had seen her often enough before; the fatal face and form must havebeen well known in the streets and palaces of Troy, however retired alife Helen might well have thought it becoming in her unhappy positionto lead. But the fair vision comes upon their eyes with a new andever-increasing enchantment. They say each to the other as they lookupon her, “It is no blame to Greeks or Trojans to fight for such awoman--she is worth all the ten years of war; still, let her embark andgo home, lest we and our children suffer more for her.” Even theearliest critics, when the finer shades of criticism were littleunderstood, were forcibly struck with the art of the poet in selectinghis witnesses for the defence. The Roman Quintilian had said nearly allthat modern taste has since confirmed. He bids the reader mark who givesthis testimony to Helen’s charms. Not the infatuated Paris, who has sethis own honour and his country’s welfare at nought for the sake of anunlawful passion; not some young Trojan, who might naturally be ready tovow “the world well lost” for such a woman; nor yet any of the vulgarcrowd, easily impressed, and always extravagant in its praise or blame;but these grave and reverend seniors, men of cold passions and calmjudgment, fathers whose sons were fighting and falling for this woman’ssake, and even Priam himself, whose very crown and kingdom she hadbrought in deadly peril. He receives her, as she draws near, with gentlecourtesy. Plainly, in his estimation, her unhappy position does notinvolve necessarily shame or disgrace. This opens one of the difficultquestions of the moral doctrine of the Iliad, which can only beunderstood by bearing in mind the supernatural machinery of the poem. Tothe modern reader, the character of Helen, and the light in which she isregarded alike by Greeks and Trojans, present an anomaly in morals whichis highly unsatisfactory. It is not as if Homer, like the worst writersof the Italian school, set marriage vows at nought, and made a jest ofunchastity. Far otherwise; the heathen bard on such points took aninfinitely higher tone than many so-called Christian poets. Thedifficulty lies in the fact that throughout the poem, while the crime isreprobated, the criminal meets with forbearance, and even sympathy. Ourfirst natural impulse with regard to Helen is to look upon her much inthe light in which she herself, in one of her bitter confessions, saysshe is looked upon by the mass of the Trojans:--    “Throughout wide Troy I see no friendly eye,     And Trojans shudder as I pass them by.”But this feeling, we must remember, arose much more from her being thecause of all the miseries of the siege, than from her having left herGreek husband. Priam and Hector--who have certainly not a lowermorality, and a higher nobility and unselfishness, than the mass oftheir countrymen--show no such feeling against her; on the contrary,they treat her with scrupulous delicacy and consideration. So also theleaders of the Greek forces betray no consciousness that they arefighting, after all, for a worthless woman; rather, she is a prize to bereclaimed, and Menelaus himself is ready from the first to receive herback again. How is this? Some have understood the poet to represent herabduction from her home to have been forcible--that she was carried offby Paris entirely against her will; but even allowing this (which is notconsistent with many passages in the poem), it would not excuse orpalliate her voluntary acceptance of such a degraded position throughoutthe subsequent story. The real explanation is given in a few words byPriam in the scene before us.                “Not thee I blame,    But to the gods I owe this woful war.”In Homer’s sight, as in Priam’s, she is the victim of Venus. She is “thevictim of passion,” only in a more literal and personal sense than weuse the expression. Love, lawful or unlawful, was a divine--that is, asupernatural--force, to the mind of the poet. The spells of Venus areirresistible: that fatal gift of beauty is the right by which thegoddess takes possession of her, and leads her captive at her evil will.Helen herself feels her own degradation far more deeply, in fact, thanany one else seems to feel it; no one uses any expressions about herhalf so bitter as those which she applies to herself; “shameless,”“bringer of sorrow,” “whose name shall be a by-word and a reproach,” arethe terms she uses--    “Oh that the day my mother gave me birth,     Some storm had on the mountains cast me forth!”We must judge Homer’s characters with reference to the light of hisreligious creed--if creed it were--or at least with reference to thesupernatural element employed in the Iliad. We shall be safe, then, inseeing Helen through Homer’s eyes. We separate her unconsciously, as hedoes, from her fault. Look upon that as the poet does, as she doesherself, as Priam and Hector and Menelaus do, as her fate, hermisfortune, the weird that she has been doomed to dree,--and then, whata graceful womanly character remains! Gentle and daughterlike to theaged Priam, humble and tearful in the presence of her noble and generousbrother-in-law Hector, as disdainful as she dares to be to her ignoblelord and lover,--tender, respectful, regretful, towards the gallanthusband she has deserted.So she comes in all her grace and beauty, and takes her seat by the oldKing’s side upon the watch-tower, looking out upon the camp of theGreeks. He bids her tell him the names of such of the kings and chiefsas she can recognise. One there is who seems indeed a “king of men,” bythe grace of nature. There are taller warriors in the host; but none ofsuch majestic mien and right royal bearing. It is, indeed, Agamemnon theson of Atreus, as Helen informs him,--    “Wide-reigning, mighty monarch, ruler good,     And valiant warrior; in my husband’s name,     Lost as I am, I called him brother once.”Another chief attracts Priam’s attention, as he strides along in frontof the lines. Less in stature than Agamemnon, he is broader in the chestand shoulders. Helen knows him well. It is Ulysses, son of Laertes,“the man of many wiles;” nursed among the rugged cliffs of his islandkingdom of Ithaca, but already a traveller well versed in the ways ofmen, the stratagems of war, and the counsels of princes. He isrecognised, too, now that Helen names him, by some of the Trojan elders;for he, it must be remembered (and Homer assumes that we know it), hadaccompanied Menelaus in the embassy to demand Helen’s restitution. OldAntenor, now sitting by Priam’s side, well remembers the remarkablestranger, whom he had lodged and entertained as a public guest. Thepicture he draws of him is one of the most graphic and individual of allHomer’s characters.    “For hither when on thine account to treat,     Brave Menelaus and Ulysses came,     I lodged them in my house, and loved them both,     And studied well the form and mind of each.     As they with Trojans mixed in social guise,     When both were standing, o’er his comrade high     With broad-set shoulders Menelaus stood:     Seated, Ulysses was the nobler form:     Then, in the great assembly, when to all     Their public speech and argument they framed,     In fluent language Menelaus spoke,     In words though few, yet clear; though young in years,     No wordy babbler, wasteful of his speech:     But when the skilled Ulysses rose to speak,     With downcast visage would he stand, his eyes     Bent on the ground; the staff he bore, nor back     He waved, nor forward, but like one untaught,     He held it motionless; who only saw,     Would say that he was mad, or void of sense:     But when his chest its deep-toned voice sent forth,     With words that fell like flakes of wintry snow,     No mortal with Ulysses could compare;     Then, little recked we of his outward show.” (D.)A third hero catches the eye of the Trojan king, as well he may--aleader like Saul, “taller by the head and shoulders than the restof the people”--and he asks Helen to name him also. This is Ajax ofCrete, son of Telamon, a giant chieftain, “the bulwark of the Greeks,”represented here in the Iliad as easy-tempered and somewhat heavy, asit is the wont of giants to be, degraded by medieval and modern poetsinto a mere bulk without brains. “Mars’ idiot,” Shakespeare calls him,“who has not so much wit as would stop the eye of Helen’s needle.”Shirley, in his ‘Ajax and Ulysses,’ carries out the same popularnotion:--    “And now I look on Ajax Telamon,     I may compare him to some spacious building;     His body holds vast rooms of entertainment,     And lower parts maintain the offices;     Only the garret, his exalted head,     Useless for wise receipt, is filled with lumber.”By the side of Ajax Helen also marks King Idomeneus of Crete, a frequentguest in the palace of Menelaus in happier times; for the court ofSparta, as will be seen hereafter in the Odyssey, was in these heroicdays a centre of civilisation and refinement. Two chiefs Helen’s anxiouseyes vainly try to discern amongst the crowd of her countrymen,--    “My own two brethren, and my mother’s sons,     Castor and Pollux; Castor, horseman bold,     Pollux, unmatched in pugilistic skill;     In Lacedæmon have they stayed behind?     Or can it be, in ocean-going ships     That they have come indeed, but shame to join     The fight of warriors, fearful of the shame     And deep disgrace that on my name attend?” (D.)Helen’s self-reproachful surmises have not reached the truth. The “GreatTwin Brethren,” who had once already (so the ancient legend said)rescued their beautiful sister in her girlhood from the hands ofTheseus, who had been amongst the mighty hunters of the Calydonian boar,and had formed part of the adventurous crew of the Argo, had finishedtheir mortal warfare years before in a raid in Messenia; but to reappearas demigods in Greek and Roman legend,--the spirit horsemen who ralliedthe Roman line in the great fight with the Latins at the Lake Regillus,the “shining stars” who lighted the sailors on the stormy Adriatic, andgave their names to the ship in which St Paul was cast away.    “Back comes the chief in triumph,       Who, in the hour of fight,     Hath seen the Great Twin Brethren       In harness on his right.     Safe comes the ship to harbour,       Through billows and through gales,     If once the Great Twin Brethren       Sit shining on the sails.”[15]This picturesque dialogue between Priam and his fascinating guest isinterrupted far too soon for the reader’s complete enjoyment--somewhattoo abruptly, indeed, for its perfection. One would like to have heardHelen’s estimate of the other leaders of the Greeks; of Diomed, of thelesser Ajax, of Nestor, of Mnestheus the Athenian; and it is hardlypossible not to fancy that the scene has been left by the poetincomplete, or that some portion has been lost past recovery. Thetragedian Æschylus, who was full of the true Homeric spirit, carried outthe idea to what seems its natural completion in a remarkable scene of‘The Seven Chiefs against Thebes,’ to which we may hope to introduceour readers more fully hereafter. Euripides, in his ‘Phœnissæ,’ adoptsthe very same machinery; and Tasso has also imitated the scene in his‘Jerusalem Delivered,’[16] where he brings Erminia on the walls,pointing out to King Aladine the persons of the most renowned of thebesieging knights.The interruption is as little satisfactory to Priam as to the reader. Aherald summons the king of Troy to a conference in the mid-space betweenthe city walls and the enemy’s leaguer, in order to ratify thearmistice, while Paris and Menelaus decide their quarrel in singlecombat. The old man mounts his chariot, “shuddering,” as foreboding thedefeat and death of his son. Agamemnon and Ulysses on the one side,Priam and Antenor on the other, duly slay the sacrificial lambs, andmake joint appeal to Jupiter, the Avenger of oaths, pouring the red wineupon the earth with solemn imprecation, that so may flow forth theheart’s blood of him who on either part shall break the truce. And thegod listens as before, but does not accept the appeal. Priam withdraws,for he cannot bear to be a spectator of his son’s peril. Hector andUlysses, precisely in the fashion of the marshals in the tournaments ofchivalry, measure out the lists; the rest of the Greeks lie down on theground beside their horses and chariots, while the lots are cast whichshall first throw the spear. The chance falls to Paris. He throws, andstrikes full and fair in the centre of Menelaus’ round shield. But theseasoned bull’s hide turns the point, and it does not penetrate. Nextcomes the turn of Menelaus. Paris has ventured no appeal to heaven; butthe Greek king lifts his voice in prayer to Jupiter for vengeance onthe traitor who has so abused his hospitality, before he poises his longlance carefully and hurls it at his enemy. Right through shield,breastplate, and linen vest goes the good Greek weapon; but Paris leansback to avoid it, and it only grazes him. Menelaus rushes forward, swordin hand, and smites a downright blow on Paris’ crest. But the Trojanhelmet proves of better quality than the shield, and the Greek bladeflies in shivers. Maddened by his double failure, he rushes on hisenemy, and seizing him by the horse-hair crest, drags him off by mainstrength towards the ranks of the Greeks. But in this extremity thegoddess of love comes to the rescue of her favourite. At her touch thetough bullhide strap of Paris’ head-piece, which was all but chokinghim, breaks, and leaves the empty helmet in the hands of Menelaus. Hehurls it amongst his comrades in disappointment and disgust, and rushesonce more in pursuit of Paris. But Venus has wrapt him in a mist, andcarried him off; and while the son of Atreus rushes like a baffled lionup and down the lists in quest of him, while even the Trojans are aidingin the search, and no man among them would have hidden him--for “theyall hated him like black death”--he is safely laid by the goddess inHelen’s chamber. The scene in which she receives him is, like all therest of her story, a beautiful contradiction. Her first greeting isbitter enough. Either her heart has been indeed with Menelaus in thefight--or at least she would have had her present husband come back fromthe field, dead or alive, in some more honourable fashion--    “Back from the battle? Would thou there hadst died     Beneath a warrior’s arm whom once I called     My husband! Vainly didst thou boast erewhile     Thine arm, thy dauntless courage, and thy spear,     The warlike Menelaus should subdue!     Go now again, and challenge to the fight     The warlike Menelaus.--Be thou ware!     I warn thee, pause, ere madly thou presume     With fair-haired Menelaus to contend!” (D.)Brave words! but still, as of old, the fatal spells of Venus are uponher, and Paris’ misadventure in the lists is all too soon condoned.CHAPTER III.THE BROKEN TRUCE.The Greeks claim the victory--reasonably, since the Trojan champion hasfled the lists; but again the intrigues of the court of Olympusinterfere to interrupt the course of mortal justice. The gods of Homerare not the gods of Epicurus’ creed, who, as our English poet sings,“lie beside their nectar, careless of mankind.” They are anything butcareless, so far as the affairs of mortals are concerned; but theirinterference is regulated by the most selfish motives. Men are thepuppets whom they make to dance for their gratification--the counterswith which they play their Olympian game, and try to defeat andcheckmate each other. Even the respect which they pay to the mortal whois regular in the matter of offering sacrifices is entirely selfish--itseems to be merely the sensual appetite for fat roasts and rich savours.They are commonly influenced by jealousy, pique, revenge, orfavouritism; and where they do punish the wrongdoer, it is far moreoften from a sense of _lèse-majesté_--a slight offered to some causewhich is under their special protection--than from any moral indignationat wrong itself. When the scene opens in the fourth book of the poem,it seems to pass at once from serious melodrama to broad comedy; and butthat these dwellers in Olympus really rule the fortunes of the tale, itwould be scarcely possible not to believe that the poet so intended it.We are introduced again, then, to Olympus; and, as before, to a quarrelamong the Immortals. It is Jove this time who is the aggressor. He hasseen the result of the combat, and taunts Juno with the double patronageextended to the Greeks by herself and Minerva--which, after all, hasfailed--while Venus, more active and energetic, has rescued herfavourite. However, he awards the victory to Menelaus; and suggests, asa solution to all disputes and difficulties, that now Helen should begiven up, the Greeks go home, and so the fate of Troy be averted. At thethought of her enemy thus escaping, the queen of the gods cannot containher rage. Jupiter gives way. He loves Troy much, but domestic peace andquietness more. He warns his queen, however, that if he now consents togive up Troy to her insatiable revenge, she shall not stand in his wayhereafter, in case some community of mortals who may be her especialfavourites shall incur his royal displeasure. And Juno, with that utterindifference to human suffering, or human justice, which characterisesthe deities of Olympus, makes answer in these words:--    “Three cities there are dearest to my heart;     Argos, and Sparta, and the ample streets     Of rich Mycenæ; work on them thy will--     Destroy them, if thine anger they incur--     I will not interpose nor hinder thee.”In furtherance of this strange compact, Minerva is once more sent downto the plains of Troy. Her mission now is to incite the Trojans to breakthe truce by some overt act, and thus not only renew the war, but putthemselves plainly in the wrong. Clothing herself in the human shape ofthe son of old Antenor, she mingles in the Trojan ranks, and addressesherself to the cunning bowman Pandarus. His character in the Iliad hasnothing in common with the “Sir Pandarus of Troy,” whose name, as thebase uncle of Cressida, has passed into an unwholesome by-word, and whomLydgate, Chaucer, and, lastly, Shakespeare, borrowed from the medievalromancers. Here he is but an archer of known skill, somewhat given todisplay, with his bow of polished ibex-horns tipped with gold, and vainof his reputation, whom the goddess easily tempts to end the long war atonce by a timely shot, and win immortal renown by taking off Menelaus.With a brief prayer and a vow of a hecatomb to Apollo, the god of thebow--who is supposed to be as ready as the rest of the immortals to abetan act of treachery on such conditions--Pandarus ensconces himselfbehind the shields of his comrades, and choosing out his arrow with thesame care which we read of in the great exploits of more modern bowmen,he discharges it point-blank at the unsuspecting Menelaus. The shaftflies true enough, but Minerva is at hand to avert the actual peril fromthe Greek hero: she turns the arrow aside--    “As when a mother from her infant’s cheek,     Wrapt in sweet slumbers, brushes off a fly.”It is a pretty simile; but the result is not so entirely harmless. Thearrow strikes in the belt, and so meets the double resistance of beltand corslet. It draws blood, nevertheless, in a stream; and bothMenelaus and Agamemnon at first fear that the wound is mortal;--    “Great Agamemnon shuddered as he saw     The crimson blood-drops issuing from the wound,     Shuddered the warlike Menelaus’ self;     But when the sinew and the arrow-head     He saw projecting, back his spirit came.     Then, deeply groaning, Agamemnon spoke,     As Menelaus by the hand he held,     And with him groaned his comrades; ‘Brother dear,     Fatal to thee hath been the oath I swore,     When thou stoodst forth alone for Greece to fight;     Wounded by Trojans, who their plighted troth     Have trodden under foot.’” (D.)Two points are remarkable in this passage: first, the tenderness whichAgamemnon shows towards his younger brother, even to the point ofself-reproach at having allowed him to fight Paris at all, though in aquarrel which was so thoroughly his own. His expressions of grief andremorse at the thought of going home to Greece without him (which run toconsiderable length), though somewhat tinged with selfishness, inasmuchas he feels his own honour at stake, are much more like the feeling of aparent than of an elder brother. Again, the picture of Menelaus“shuddering” at his own wound--so sensitive to the dread of death thathe apparently all but faints, until he is reassured by finding that thebarb of the arrow has not really penetrated--is utterly inconsistentwith our English notions of a hero. We have to bear in mind, here andelsewhere, that these Greek heroes, of whatever race we are to supposethem to be, are of an entirely different temperament to us cold andself-restrained northerns. They are highly sensitive to bodily pain,very much given to groans and tears, and very much afraid of death forthemselves, however indifferent to human life in the case of others.Death, to these sensuous Greeks, was an object of dread and aversion,chiefly because it implied to their minds something like annihilation.However vivid in some passages of their poets is the description ofthose happy Elysian fields where the souls of heroes dwelt, the popularbelief gave to the disembodied spirit but a shadowy and colourlessexistence.The wound is soon stanched by the aid of the skilful leech Machaon, sonof Æsculapius (and therefore grandson of Apollo “the Healer”), but whois a warrior and chieftain as well as the rest, though he has placed hisskill at the service of Agamemnon. The King of Men himself, as soon ashis brother’s hurt is tended, rushes along the lines, rousing chiefs andclansmen to avenge the treachery of the enemy. Idomeneus of Crete, Ajaxthe Greater and the Less, Mnestheus of Athens, Ulysses, Diomed--to allin turn he makes his passionate appeal; to some, in language which theyare inclined to resent, as implying that they were disinclined for thecombat. Diomed and Sthenelus he even reminds of the brave deeds of theirfathers Tydeus and Capaneus in the great siege of Thebes, and stingsthem with the taunt, that the sons will never win the like renown.Diomed hears in silence; but the son of Capaneus inherits, with all thebravery, something of the insolence of the chief who swore that “with orwithout the gods” he would burn Thebes: he answers the great king inwords which have yet a certain nobility in their self-assertion--   “Atrides, lie not, when thou know’st the truth;    We hold ourselves far better than our sires;    We took the strength of seven-gated Thebes,    Though with a smaller host we stormed her towers,    Strong in heaven’s omens and the help of Jove;    For them--their own presumption was their fall.”All the leaders of the Greeks eagerly marshal their forces at the King’scall. Nestor’s experienced counsel orders the line of battle--so well,that subsequent commanders were fain to take a lesson from it.   “In the front rank, with chariot and with horse,    He placed the mounted warriors; in the rear,    Num’rous and brave, a cloud of infantry,    Compactly massed, to stem the tide of war.    Between the two he placed th’ inferior troops,    That e’en against their will they needs must fight.    The horsemen first he charged, and bade them keep    Their horses well in hand, nor wildly rush    Amid the tumult: ‘See,’ he said, ‘that none,    In skill or valour over-confident,    Advance before his comrades, nor alone    Retire; for so your lines were easier forced;    But ranging each beside a hostile car,    Thrust with your spears; for such the better way;    By men so disciplined, in elder days,    Were lofty walls and fencèd towers destroyed.’” (D.)CHAPTER IV.THE FIRST DAY’S BATTLE.As before, while the Greek line advances in perfect silence, the Trojansmake their onset with loud shouts and a clamour of discordant war-criesin many tongues. Mars animates the Trojans, Minerva the Greeks; whileFear and Panic hover over the two armies, and Strife--whom the poetdescribes in words which are the very echo of Solomon’s proverb--“Thebeginning of strife is as when one letteth out water”--   “With humble crest at first, anon her head,    While yet she treads the earth, affronts the skies.”The two armies close in battle, only embittered by the broken truce. Thedescription is a good specimen of the poet’s powers, and Lord Derby’stranslation is sufficiently close:--   “Then rose the mingled shouts and groans of men    Slaying and slain; the earth ran red with blood.    As when descending from the mountain’s brow    Two wintry torrents from their copious source    Pour downwards to the narrow pass, where meet    Their mingled waters in some deep ravine,    Their weight of flood, on the far mountain’s side    The shepherd hears the roar; so loud arose    The shouts and yells of those commingling hosts.”[17]Then begins one of those remarkable descriptions of a series of singlecombats between warriors of note on either side, in which Homer delightsand excels. It must be confessed that they are somewhat wearisome to amodern reader; although, as has been well observed, the details ofattack and defence, wounds and death, are varied in a fashion whichshows that the artist was thoroughly master of his work; and it is evensaid that in the physical results assigned to each particular wound hehas shown no mean knowledge of anatomy. Still, the continuous catalogueof ghastly wounds and dying agonies is uncongenial with our more refinedsympathies. But it was quite in harmony with the tastes of ruder days.We find the same apparent repetition of single combats in the medievalromances--notably in Mallory’s King Arthur; and they were probably notthe least popular portions of the tale. Even a stronger parallel casemight be found in the description of a prize-fight in the columns ofsporting newspapers, not so many years ago, when each particular blowand its results, up to “Round 102,” were graphically described inlanguage quite as figurative, if not so poetic, as Homer’s; and found,we must suppose, a sufficient circle of readers to whom it was not onlyintelligible but highly interesting. The poet who recites--as we mustsuppose Homer to have done--must above everything else excite andinterest his audience: his lay must be rich in incident; and to anaudience who were all more or less warlike, no incidents could be soexciting as the details of battle. There is much savageness in Homer’scombats; but savageness is to the taste of men whose only means ofexcitement is through their grosser senses, and a love of the horriblein fact or fiction is by no means extinct even in our own day.Young Antilochus, the son of Nestor’s old age, draws the first blood inthe battle. He kills Echepolus.    “Beneath his horsehair-plumèd helmet’s peak    The sharp spear struck; deep in his forehead fixed,    It pierced the bone: then darkness veiled his eyes,    And, like a tower, amid the press he fell.”Over his dead body the combat grows furious--the Greeks endeavouring todrag him off to strip his armour, the Trojans to prevent it. The armourof a vanquished enemy was, in these combats, something like what anenemy’s scalp is to the Indian “brave;” to carry it off in triumph, andhang it up in their own tents as a trophy, was the great ambition of theslayer and his friends. Ajax, too, slays his man--spearing him rightthrough from breast to shoulder: and the tall Trojan falls like apoplar--    “Which with his biting axe the wheelwright fells.”Ulysses, roused by the death of a friend who is killed in trying tocarry off this last body, rushes to the front, and poising his spear,looks round to choose his victim. The foremost of his enemies recoil;but he drives his weapon right through the temples of Demophoon, anatural son of Priam, as he sits high in his chariot. The Trojans waver;even Hector gives ground; the Greeks cheer, and some carry off thebodies, while the rest press forward. It is going hard with Troy, whenApollo, who sits watching the battle from the citadel, calls loudly totheir troops to remember that “there is no Achilles in the fieldto-day.” So the fight is renewed, Minerva cheering on the Greeks, asApollo does the Trojans.Diomed, the gallant son of Tydeus, now becomes the hero of the day. Hisexploits occupy, indeed, so large a portion of the next book of thepoem, that it was known as “The Deeds of Diomed,” and would form,according to one theory, a separate romance or lay of itself, exactly assome portions of the Arthurian romance have for their exclusive herosome one renowned Knight of the Round Table, as Tristram or Lancelot.Diomed fights under supernatural colours. Minerva herself not onlyinspires him with indomitable courage, but sheds over his whole person ahalo of celestial radiance before which the bravest Trojan might wellrecoil--    “Forth from his helm and shield a fiery light    There flashed, like autumn’s star, that brightest shines    When newly risen from his ocean bath.”Once more the prince of archers, Pandarus the Lycian, comes to therescue of the discomfited Trojans. He bends his bow against Diomed, whois now fighting on foot, and the arrow flies true to its mark. He seesit strike deep into the shoulder, and the red blood streams out visiblyover the breastplate. Elated by his success, he turns round and shoutshis triumphant rallying-cry to the Trojans--“The bravest of the Greeksis wounded to the death!” But his exultation is premature. Diomed getshim back to his chariot, and calls on his faithful friend and charioteerSthenelus to draw the arrow from the wound. The blood wells out fast,as the barb is withdrawn; but the hero puts up a brief prayer to hisguardian goddess for strength yet to avenge him of his adversary, whoseexulting boast he has just heard. Minerva hears. By some rapid celestialpharmacy she heals the wound at once, and gives him fresh strength andvigour, adding these words of encouragement and warning:--    “Go fearless onward, Diomed, to meet    The Trojan hosts; for I within thy breast    Thy father’s dauntless courage have infused,    Such as of old in Tydeus’ bosom dwelt,    Bold horseman, buckler-clad; and from thine eyes    The film that dimmed them I have purged away,[18]    That thou mayest well ’twixt gods and men discern.    If then some god make trial of thy force,    With other of the Immortals fight thou not;    But should Jove’s daughter Venus dare the fray,    Thou need’st not shun at her to cast thy spear.” (D.)With redoubled vigour and fury the hero returns to the battle; and againthe Trojans’ names, to each of which the poet contrives to give sometouch of individual character, swell the list of his victims. Æneasmarks his terrible career, and goes to seek for Pandarus. He points outto him the movements of the Greek champion, and bids him try upon hisperson the far-famed skill that had so nearly turned the fate of war inthe case of Menelaus. Pandarus tells him of his late unsuccessfulattempt, and declares his full belief that some glamour of more thanmortal power has made Diomed invulnerable to human weapons. He bitterlyregrets, as he tells Æneas, that he did not follow the counsels of hisfather Lycaon, and bring with him to the campaign, like other chiefs ofhis rank, some of those noble steeds of whom eleven pair stand always inhis father’s stalls, “champing the white barley and the spelt.” He hadfeared, in truth, that they might lack provender in the straits of thesiege:--    “Woe worth the day, when from the glittering wall,    Hector to serve, I took my shafts and bow,    And to fair Ilion, from my father’s hall,    Captain of men, did with my Lycians go!    If ever I return, if ever I know    My country, my dear wife, my home again,    Let me fall headless to an enemy’s blow,    Save the red blaze of fire these arms contain!” (W.)Æneas bids him mount with him into his chariot, and together they willencounter this redoubtable Greek. Pandarus takes the spear and shield,while Æneas guides the horses. Diomed is still fighting on foot, whenSthenelus, who attends him with the chariot, sees the two hostile chiefsbearing down upon him. He begs his comrade to remount, and avoid theencounter with two such adversaries. Diomed indignantly refuses. He willslay both, with the help of Heaven; and he charges Sthenelus, if suchshould be the happy result, to leave his own horses and chariot,securing the reins carefully to the chariot-front, and make prize of thefar-famed steeds of Æneas--they are descended from the immortal breedbestowed of old by Jupiter upon King Tros. So, on foot still, he awaitstheir onset. Pandarus stands high in the chariot with poised weapon,and hails his enemy as he comes within hurling distance:--    “Prince, thou art met! though late in vain assailed,    The spear may enter where the arrow failed.”It does enter, and piercing through the tough ox-hide of the shield,stands fixed in the breastplate. Again, with premature triumph, heshouts exultingly to Diomed that at last he has got his death-wound. Butthe Greek quietly tells him that he has missed--which assuredly hehimself is not going to do. He hurls his spear in turn with fatal aim:and the poet tells us with ghastly detail how it entered beneath theeyeball, and passed down through the “white teeth” and tongue--    “Till the bright point looked out beneath the chin”--and Pandarus the Lycian closes his career, free at least from thebaseness which medieval romances have attached to his name.Æneas, in obedience to the laws of heroic chivalry, at once leaps downfrom the chariot to defend against all comers the body of his fallencomrade.    “And like a lion fearless in his strength    Around the corpse he stalked this way and that,    His spear and buckler round about him held,    To all who dared approach him threat’ning death.”Diomed in this case avails himself of a mode of attack not uncommon withHomer’s heroes. He seizes a huge stone--which not two men of thisdegenerate age (says Homer, with a poet’s cynicism for the present)could have lifted--and hurls it at the Trojan prince. It strikes him onthe hip, crushes the joint, and brings him to his knees. But that hisgoddess-mother Venus comes to his rescue, the world had heard the lastof Æneas, and Virgil must have sought another hero for his great poem.    “About her much-loved son her arms she throws--    Her arms, whose whiteness match the falling snows;    Screened from the foe behind her shining veil,    The swords wave harmless and the javelins fail.” (P.)Sthenelus, for his part, remembers the orders of his friend and chief,and drives off at once to the Greek camp with the much-coveted horses ofÆneas. Diomed rushes in pursuit of Venus--whom he knows, by his new giftof clear vision--as she carries off her son through the ranks of theTrojans. She, at least, of all the divinities of Olympus, had nobusiness, thought the Greek, in the _mêlée_ of battle. Besides, he hadreceived from Minerva special permission to attack her. Mostungallantly, to our notions, he does so. The scene is such a curiousone, that it is well to give Lord Derby’s version of it:--    “Her, searching through the crowd, at length he found,    And springing forward, with his pointed spear    A wound inflicted on her tender hand.    Piercing th’ ambrosial veil, the Graces’ work,    The sharp spear grazed her palm below the wrist.    Forth from the wound th’ immortal current flowed,    Pure ichor, life-stream of the blessed Gods;    They eat no bread, they drink no ruddy wine,    And bloodless thence and deathless they become.    The goddess shrieked aloud, and dropped her son;    But in his arms Apollo bore him off    In a thick cloud enveloped, lest some Greek    Might pierce his breast, and rob him of his life.    Loud shouted brave Tydides, as she fled:    ‘Daughter of Jove, from battle-fields retire;    Enough for thee weak women to delude;    If war thou seek’st, the lesson thou shalt learn    Shall cause thee shudder but to hear it named.’    Thus he; but ill at ease, and sorely pained,    The Goddess fled: her, Iris, swift as wind,    Caught up, and from the tumult bore away,    Weeping with pain, her fair skin soiled with blood.”It is the original of the grand passage in the ‘Paradise Lost,’ in whichthe English poet has adopted almost literally the Homeric idea ofsuffering inflicted on an immortal essence, while carefully avoiding theludicrous element in the scene. In the battle of the Angels, Michaelcleaves Satan down the right side:--    “The griding sword with discontinuous wound    Passed through him; but th’ ethereal substance closed,    Not long divisible; and from the gash    A stream of nectar’ous humour issuing flowed,    Sanguine, such as celestial spirits may bleed.”            --Par. Lost, vi. 329.In sore plight the goddess mounts to Olympus, and there, throwingherself into the arms of her mother Dione, bewails the wrong she hassuffered at the hands of a presumptuous mortal. Dione comforts her asbest she may, reminding her how in times past other of the Olympiandeities have had to endure woes from men: Mars, when the giants Otus andEphialtes bound him for thirteen months in brazen fetters; Juno herself,the queen of Heaven, and Pluto, the king of the Shades, had been woundedby the daring Hercules. She foretells, however, an untimely death forthe presumptuous hero who has raised his hand against a goddess:--                        “Fool and blind!    Unknowing he how short his term of life,    Who fights against the gods! for him no child    Upon his knees shall lisp a father’s name,    Safe from the war and battle-field returned.    Brave as he is, let Diomed beware    He meet not with a mightier than himself:    Then fair Ægiale, Adrastus’ child,    The noble wife of valiant Diomed,    Shall long, with lamentations loud, disturb    The slumbers of her house, and vainly mourn    Her youthful lord, the bravest of the Greeks.” (D.)But Dione is no prophet. Diomed returned home (if the later legends areto be believed) to find that his wife Ægiale had been anything butinconsolable during his absence.Venus’ wound is healed, and her tears are soon dried. But Minerva--whoseprovince in the celestial government seems to be not only wisdom butsatire--cannot resist a jest upon the unfortunate plight of the Queen ofLove. She points her out to Jupiter, and suggests as a probableexplanation of the wound, that she has been trying to lead astray someother fair Greek, like Helen,--    “And as her hand the gentle dame caressed,     A golden clasp has scratched her slender arm.”Jupiter smiles, and calling his pouting daughter-goddess to his side,recommends her in future to leave to Mars and Minerva the dangers of thebattle-field, and confine her own prowess to campaigns in which she islikely to be more victorious.Diomed is still rushing in pursuit of Æneas. He knows that Apollo isshielding him; but not even this knowledge checks the impetuous Greek.    “Thrice was his onset made, with murd’rous aim,     And thrice Apollo struck his glittering shield;     But when with godlike force he sought to make     His fourth attempt, the Far-destroyer spake     In terms of awful menace; ‘Be advised,     Tydides, and retire; nor as a god     Thyself esteem, since not alike the race     Of gods immortal and of earth-born men.’” (D.)Diomed accepts the warning, and Æneas is carried off to the temple ofApollo in the citadel, where Latona and Diana tend and heal him. Apollomeanwhile replaces him in the battle by a phantom likeness, round whichGreeks and Trojans continue the fight. Then he calls his brother deitythe War-god to the rescue of the hard-prest Trojans, and entreats him toscare from the field this irreverent and outrageous champion, who, heverily believes, would lift his spear against Olympian Jove himself. Inthe likeness of a Thracian chief, Mars calls Hector to the rescue; andthe Trojan prince leaps from his chariot, and, crying his battle-cry,turns the tide of war. Æneas is restored, sound and well, to his placein the _mêlée_--somewhat indeed to the astonishment of his friends, whohad seen him lying so long grievously wounded; but, as the poet pithilyremarks, little time had they to ask him questions. The two Ajaxes,Ulysses, Menelaus, and Agamemnon himself, “king of men,” come to theforefront of the Greek battle: and the young Antilochus, son of thevenerable Nestor, notably wins his spurs. But the Trojans havesupernatural aid: and Diomed, of the purged vision, cries to his friendsto beware, for that he sees the War-god in their front brandishing hishuge spear. The Greek line warily gives ground before this immortaladversary. The Queen of Heaven can no longer endure to be a merespectatress of the peril of her favourites. She obtains permission fromJupiter to send Minerva against Mars: and the two goddesses, seated inJuno’s chariot of state, glide down from Olympus--    “Midway between the earth and starry heaven”--and alight upon the plain of Troy. There Juno, taking human shape,taunts the Greek troops with cowardice--    “In form of Stentor of the brazen voice,    Whose shout was as the shout of fifty men”--and whose name has made a familiar place for itself in our Englishvocabulary.    “Shame on ye, Greeks, base cowards! brave alone    In outward semblance: while Achilles yet    Went forth to battle, from the Dardan gates    The Trojans never ventured to advance.”Minerva seeks out Diomed, whom she finds leaning on his chariot, restingawhile from the fight, and bathing the wound made by the arrow ofPandarus. She taunts him with his inferiority to his great fatherTydeus, who was, she reminds him, “small in stature, but every inch asoldier.” Diomed excuses himself by reference to her own charge tohim--to fight with none of the immortals save Venus only. But now thegoddess withdraws the prohibition, and herself--putting on the “helmetof darkness,” to hide herself from Mars--takes her place beside him inthe chariot, instead of Sthenelus, his henchman and charioteer: and thechariot-axle groans beneath the more than mortal load. They drive infull career against the War-god: in vain he hurls his spear againstDiomed, for the hand of the goddess turns it safely aside. The mortalchampion is more successful: his spear strikes Mars in the flank,piercing the flesh, and drawing from him, as from Venus, the heavenly“ichor.” And the wounded god cries out with a shout like that of tenthousand men, so that both hosts listen to the sound with awe andtrembling. He too, like Venus, flies to Olympus, and there makes piteouscomplaint of the impious deeds which, at the instigation of Minerva,this headstrong mortal is permitted to do. His father Jupiter rates himsoundly, as the outlaw of the Olympian family, inheriting his motherJuno’s headstrong temper. However, he bids Pæon, the physician of theimmortals, heal the wound, and Hebe prepares him a bath. Juno andMinerva have done their work, having driven Mars from the field, andthey too quit the plains of Troy, and leave the mortal heroes tothemselves.While Diomed still pursues his career of slaughter, Menelaus gives tokenof that easy and pliant disposition which half explains his behaviour toHelen. He has at his mercy a Trojan who has been thrown from hischariot, and begs his life. The fair-haired king is about to sparehim,--as none in the whole story of the fight is spared,--when hisbrother Agamemnon comes up, and after chiding him for suchsoft-heartedness, pins the wretched suppliant to the ground with hisashen spear.So the fight goes on through the sixth book; which is, however, chieflyremarkable for two of the most striking episodes in the poem. The firstis the meeting of Diomed with the young Lycian captain, Glaucus.Encountering him in the field, and struck by his bold bearing, he askshis name and race. Glaucus replies with that pathetic simile which,found under many forms in many poets, has its earliest embodiment in theverse of the Hebrew Psalmist and the Greek bard. “The days of man arebut as grass.”        “Brave son of Tydeus, wherefore set thy mind        My race to know? the generations are        As of the leaves, so also of mankind.        As the leaves fall, now withering in the wind,        And others are put forth, and spring descends,        Such on the earth the race of men we find;        Each in his order a set time attends;    One generation rises and another ends.” (W.)The young chieftain goes on, nevertheless, to announce his birth andlineage. He is the grandson of the noble Bellerophon--the rider of thewondrous horse Pegasus and the slayer of the monster Chimæra--all ofwhose exploits he narrates at length, with some disregard toprobabilities, in the full roar of the battle round him. It turns outthat he and Diomed are bound together by a tie which all of Greek bloodscrupulously respected--the rights of hospitality exercised towards eachother by some of their ancestors. Such obligations descended from fatherto son, and served from time to time to mitigate the fierce andvindictive spirit of an age when every man’s hand was in some sortagainst another. The grandfather of Diomed had been Bellerophon’s guestand friend. So the Greek places his spear in the ground, and vows thathe will not raise his arm against Glaucus. There are enough besides ofthe Trojan allies for him to slay, and Glaucus may find Greeks enough onwhom to flesh his valour; but for themselves, the old hereditary bondshall hold good, and in token of amity they will change armour. A goodexchange, indeed, for Diomed; for whereas his own is but of the ordinarybrass or bronze, the young Lycian’s panoply is richly inlaid withgold--“a hundred oxen’s worth for the worth of nine.” The Greek wordshave passed into a proverb.The Trojans are still hard prest, and by the advice of his brotherHelenus, who has the gift of soothsaying, and is as it were the domesticpriest of the royal household, Hector hastens to the city, and directshis mother Hecuba to go with her matrons in solemn procession to thetemple of Pallas, and beseech the goddess to withdraw the terribleDiomed from the field. In the palace, to his indignation, he findsParis dallying with Helen, and polishing his armour instead of joiningthe fight. Hector upbraids him sharply: and Helen, in a speech full ofself-abasement, laments the unworthiness of her paramour. Hector speaksno word of reproach to her, though he gently declines her invitation torest himself also a while from the battle. Paris promises to follow himat once to the field; and Hector moves on to his own wife’s apartments,to see her and his child once more before he goes back to the combatwhich he has a half-foreboding will end fatally for himself, whatever bethe fortunes of Troy.And now we are introduced to the second female character in the poem,standing in the strongest possible contrast with that of Helen, but ofno less admirable conception. It is remarkable how entirely Homersucceeds in interesting us in his women, without having recourse to whatmight seem to us the very natural expedient of dwelling on theirpersonal charms; especially when it is taken into account that, in hissimple narrative, he has not the resources of the modern novelist, whocan make even the plainest heroine attractive by painting her mentalperfections, or setting before us the charms of her conversation. It hasbeen said that he rather assumes than describes the beauty of Helen: inthe case of Andromache, it has been remarked that he never once appliesto her any epithet implying personal attractions, though all histranslators, Lord Derby included, have been tempted to do so. It is asthe wife and mother that Andromache charms us. We readily assume thatshe is comely, graceful--all that a woman should be; but it is simplegrace of domestic character which forms the attraction of the Trojanprincess.Hector does not find her, as he expects, in the palace. She had heardhow the fortunes of the day seemed turning against the Trojans; and shehad hurried, “like one distraught,” to the tower of the citadel, to seewith her own eyes how the fight was going. He meets her at the Scæangates, with the nurse and the child, “whom Hector called Scamandrius,from the river, but the citizens Astyanax”--“defender of the city.” Thefather looks silently on his boy, and smiles; Andromache in tears clingsto her husband, and makes a pathetic appeal to him not to be tooprodigal of a life which is so dear to his wife and child. Her fate hasbeen already that of many women of her day. Her father and seven tallbrethren have been slain by the fierce Achilles, when ravaging thecountry round Troy he destroyed their native city of Cilician Thebes:her mother too is dead, and she is left alone. She adds the touchingloving confession, which Pope’s version has made popular enough even tounclassical ears--    “But while my Hector still survives, I see    My father, mother, brethren, all in thee.”Hector soothes her, but it is with a mournful foreboding of evil tocome. He values too much his own honour and fair fame to shrink from thebattle:--                      “I should blush    To face the men and long-robed dames of Troy,    If like a coward I could shun the fight;    Nor could my soul the lessons of my youth    So far forget, whose boast it still has been    In the fore-front of battle to be found,    Charged with my father’s glory and mine own.    Yet in my inmost soul too well I know    The day must come when this our sacred Troy,    And Priam’s race, and Priam’s royal self,    Shall in one common ruin be o’erthrown.” (D.)But that which wrings his heart most of all is the vision before hiseyes of his beloved wife dragged into slavery. Pope’s version of therest of the passage is so good of its kind, and has so naturalised thescene to our English conceptions, that no closer version will eversupersede it.    “Thus having spoke, th’ illustrious chief of Troy    Stretched his fond arms to clasp the lovely boy;    The babe clung crying to his nurse’s breast,    Scared at the dazzling helm and nodding crest.    With secret pleasure each fond parent smiled,    And Hector hasted to relieve his child,    The glitt’ring terrors from his brows unbound,    And placed the beaming helmet on the ground.    Then kissed the child, and lifting high in air,    Thus to the Gods preferred a father’s prayer:    ‘O thou! whose glory fills th’ ethereal throne,    And all ye deathless powers! protect my son!    Grant him, like me, to purchase just renown,    To guard the Trojans, to defend the crown,    Against his country’s foes the war to wage,    And rise the Hector of the future age!    So when triumphant from successful toils,    Of heroes slain he bears the reeking spoils,    Whole hosts may hail him with deserved acclaim,    And say--This chief transcends his father’s fame:    While pleased amidst the general shouts of Troy,    His mother’s conscious heart o’erflows with joy.’    He spoke, and fondly gazing on her charms,    Restored the pleasing burthen to her arms;    Soft on her fragrant breast the babe she laid,    Hushed to repose, and with a smile surveyed.    The troubled pleasure soon chastised by fear,    She mingled with the smile a tender tear.    The softened chief with kind compassion viewed,    And dried the falling drops, and thus pursued.”The “charms,” be it said, are entirely Pope’s idea, and do not harmonisewith the simplicity of the true Homeric picture. The husband was notthinking of his wife’s beauty. He “caresses her with his hand,” andtries to cheer her with the thought that no hero dies until his work isdone.    “For, till my day of destiny is come,    No man may take my life; and when it comes,    Nor brave nor coward can escape that day.    But go thou home, and ply thy household cares,    The loom and distaff, and appoint thy maids    Their several tasks; and leave to men of Troy,    And chief of all to me, the toils of war.” (D.)The tender yet half-contemptuous tone in which the iron soldierrelegates the woman to her own inferior cares, is true to the spirit ofevery age in which war is the main business of man’s life. Something inthe same tone is the charming scene between Hotspur and his lady inShakspeare’s ‘Henry IV.’    “_Hotspur._ Away, you trifler!--Love? I love thee not,--      I care not for thee, Kate; this is no world      To play with mammets and to tilt with lips:      We must have bloody noses and crack’t crowns,      And pass them current too.--God’s me, my horse!--      What say’st thou, Kate? What wouldst thou have with me?    _Lady Percy._ Do you not love me? Do you not indeed?      Well,--do not, then; for since you love me not,      I will not love myself.--Do you not love me?      Nay, tell me if you speak in jest, or no.    _Hotspur._ Come, wilt thou see me ride?      And when I am o’ horseback, I will swear      I love thee infinitely. But hark you, Kate:      I must not have you henceforth question me      Whither I go, nor reason whereabout;      Whither I must, I must; and, to conclude,      This evening must I leave you, gentle Kate.      I know you wise; but yet, no further wise      Than Harry Percy’s wife: constant you are--      But yet a woman: and for secrecy,      No lady closer: for I well believe      Thou wilt not utter that thou dost not know.”Hector and his wife part; he to the fight, accompanied now by Paris,girt for the battle in glittering armour, the show knight of theTrojans: Andromache back to the palace, casting many a lingering glancebehind at the gallant husband she is fated never again to see alive. TheRoman ladies of the last days of the Republic were not much given tosentiment; but we do not wonder that Brutus’s wife, Portia, knowing wellthe Homeric story, was moved to tears in looking at a picture of thisparting scene.CHAPTER V.THE SECOND DAY’S BATTLE.By the advice of his brother Helenus, who knows the counsels of heaven,Hector now challenges the Greek host to match some one of theirchieftains against him in single combat. There is an unwillingness evenamongst the bravest to accept the defiance--so terrible is the name ofHector. Menelaus--always gallant and generous--is indignant at theircowardice, and offers himself as the champion. He feels he is no matchfor Hector; but, as he says with modest confidence, the issues in suchcase lie in the hands of heaven. But Agamemnon, ever affectionatelycareful of his brother, will not suffer such unequal risk: some morestalwart warrior shall be found to maintain the honour of the Achæans.Old Nestor rises, and loudly regrets that he has no longer the eye andsinews of his youth--but the men of Greece, he sees with shame, are notnow what they were in his day. Stung by the taunt, nine chiefs spring totheir feet at once, and offer themselves for the combat. Conspicuousamongst them are Diomed, the giant Ajax, and King Agamemnon himself; andwhen the choice of a champion is referred to lot, the hopes and wishesof the whole army are audibly expressed, that on one of these three thelot may fall. It falls on Ajax; and amidst the congratulations andprayers of his comrades, the tall chieftain dons his armour, and stridesforth to meet his adversary. The combat is maintained with vigour onboth sides, till dusk comes on; the heralds interpose, and they separatewith mutual courtesies and exchange of presents.Both armies agree to a truce, that they may collect and burn their deadwho strew the plain thickly after the long day’s battle. The Trojans,dispirited by their loss, and conscious that, owing to the breach of thefirst truce by the treacherous act of Pandarus, they are fighting underthe curse of perjury, hold a council of war, in which Antenor (theNestor of Troy) proposes to restore Helen and her wealth, and so put anend at last to this weary siege. But Paris refuses--he will give backthe treasure, but not Helen; and the proposal thus made is spurned bythe Greeks as an insult. They busy themselves in building afortification--ditch, and wall, and palisade--to protect their fleetfrom any sudden incursion of the Trojans. When this great work iscompleted, they devote the next night to one of those heavy feasts anddeep carousals, to which men of the heroic mould have always had therepute of being addicted in the intervals of hard fighting. Mostopportunely, a fleet of merchant-ships comes in from Lemnos, laden withwine; in part a present sent by Euneus, son of the renowned voyagerJason, to the two royal brothers; in part a trading speculation, whichmeets with immediate success among the thirsty host. The thunder ofOlympus rolls all through the night, for the Thunderer is angry at theprolongation of the war: but the Greeks content their consciences withpouring copious libations to appease his wrath, and after theirprolonged revelry sink into careless slumber.At daybreak Jupiter holds a council in Olympus, and harangues theassembled deities at some length--with a special request that he may notbe interrupted. He forbids, on pain of his royal displeasure, anyfurther interference on the part of the Olympians on either side in thecontest; and then, mounting his chariot, descends in person to Mount Idato survey the field of battle, once more crowded with fierce combatants.He hesitates, apparently, which side he shall aid--for he has nointention of observing for himself the neutrality which he has sostrictly enjoined upon others. So he weighs in a balance the fates ofGreek and Trojan: the former draws down the scale, while the destiny ofTroy mounts to heaven. The metaphor is reversed, according to our modernnotions; it is the losing side which should be found wanting whenweighed in the balance. And so Milton has it in the passage which isundoubtedly founded on these lines of Homer. “The Omnipotent,” saysMilton,    “Hung forth in heaven His golden scales, yet seen    Betwixt Astræa and the Scorpion sign,    Wherein all things created first He weighed,    The pendulous round earth with balanced air    In counterpoise; now ponders all events,    Battles and realms; in these He put two weights,    The sequel each of parting and of fight:    The latter quick up flew and kicked the beam.”And Gabriel bids Satan look up, and mark the warning:--                      “‘For proof look up,    And read thy lot in yon celestial sign,    Where thou art weighed, and shown how light, how weak,    If thou resist!’ The Fiend looked up, and knew    His mounted scale aloft; nor more, but fled    Murmuring, and with him fled the shades of night.”            --Par. Lost, end of B. iv.In accordance with this decision the Thunderer sends his lightnings downupon the host of the Greeks, and throws them into terror and confusion.Nestor, still in the thickest of the fray, has one of his chariot-horseskilled by a shaft from the bow of Paris; and while he is thus all buthelpless, Diomed sees the terrible Hector bearing down on the old chiefin full career. He bids Nestor mount with him, and together theyencounter the Trojan prince, against whom Diomed hurls his spear: hemisses Hector, but kills his charioteer. As Diomed presses on, athunderbolt from Jupiter ploughs the ground right in front of hisstartled horses. Nestor sees in this omen the wrath of heaven; and athis entreaty Diomed reluctantly allows him to turn the horses, andretires, pursued by the loud taunts of Hector, who bids the Greek“wench” go hide herself. Thrice he half turns to meet his jesting enemy,and thrice the roll of the angry thunder warns him not to dare the wrathof the god. Hector in triumph shouts to his comrades to drive the Greeksback to their new trenches, and burn their fleet. He calls to his horsesby name (he drove a bright bay and a chestnut, and called them Whitefootand Firefly), and bids them do him good suit and service now, if ever,in return for all the care they have had from Andromache, who has fedthem day by day with her own hands, even before she would offer thewine-cup to their thirsty master. The Greeks are driven back into theirtrenches, where they are rallied by the royal brothers Agamemnon andMenelaus in person. They have too on their side a bowman as good asPandarus or Paris, who now does them gallant service. It is Teucer, theyounger brother of the huge Ajax. The description of his manner of fightwould suit almost exactly the light archer and his pavoise-bearer of themedieval battle:--    “Ajax the shield extended: Teucer then    Peered from behind, and with a shaft forth stept,    And slew one singled from the enemy’s men:    Then, as a child creeps to his mother, crept    To Ajax, who the shield before him swept.” (W.)Eight times he draws his bow, and every arrow reaches its mark in aTrojan. Twice he shoots at Hector, but each time the shaft is turnedaside, and finds some less renowned victim. Of these the last isHector’s charioteer--the second who in this day’s battle has paid theforfeit of that perilous honour. Hector leaps down to avenge his death,and Teucer, felled to the ground by a huge fragment of rock, is carriedoff the field with a broken shoulder, still covered by the shield ofAjax. The Greeks remain penned within their stockade, and nothing butthe approach of night saves their fleet from destruction. The victoriousTrojans bivouac on the field, their watch-fires lighting up the night;for Hector’s only fear now is lest his enemies should embark and setsail under cover of the darkness, and so escape the fate which he isconfident awaits them on the morrow. Mr Tennyson has chosen fortranslation the fine passage describing the scene, which closes theEighth Book:--    “As when in heaven the stars about the moon    Look beautiful, when all the winds are laid,    And every height comes out, and jutting peak,    And valley, and the immeasurable heavens    Break open to their highest, and all the stars    Shine, and the shepherd gladdens in his heart:    So many a fire between the ships and stream    Of Xanthus blazed before the towers of Troy,    A thousand on the plain; and close by each    Sat fifty in the blaze of burning fire;    And, champing golden grain, the horses stood    Hard by their chariots, waiting for the dawn.”CHAPTER VI.THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.The opening of the Ninth Book shows us the Greeks utterly disheartenedinside their intrenchments. The threat of the dishonoured Achilles isfast being accomplished: they cannot stand before Hector. Agamemnoncalls a hasty council, and proposes--in sad earnest, this time--that allshould re-embark and sail home to Greece. The proposal is received insilence by all except Diomed. He boldly taunts the king with cowardice:the other Greeks may go home if they will, but he and his good comradeSthenelus will stay and fight it out, even if they fight alone. ThenNestor takes the privilege of his age to remind Agamemnon that hisinsult to Achilles is the real cause of their present distress. Let anembassy be sent to him where he lies beside his ships, in moodyidleness, to offer him apology and compensation for the wrong. The kingconsents; and Ajax, Ulysses, and Phœnix are chosen to accompany theroyal heralds on this mission of reconciliation. Ajax--the chief who inall warlike points stands second only to Achilles himself in theestimation of the army--is a delegate to whom even the great captain ofthe Myrmidons must surely listen with respect. Phœnix has been a sort offoster-father to Achilles from his boyhood, intrusted with the care ofhim by his father Peleus, and has now accompanied him to the war by theold man’s special request, to aid him with advice and counsel. If anyone in the camp has any influence over the headstrong prince, it will bethe man who, as he says, has dandled him in his arms in his helplessinfancy. And no diplomatic enterprise could be complete without theaddition of Ulysses, the man of many devices and of persuasive tongue.The chiefs set forth, and take their way along the shore to the camp ofthe Myrmidons. They find Achilles sitting in his tent, solacing hisperturbed spirit with playing on the lyre, to the music of which hesings the deeds of heroes done in the days of old--the exact prototypeof those knightly troubadours of later times, who combined theaccomplishments of the minstrel with the prowess of the soldier. Hisfaithful henchman Patroclus sits and listens to the song. With gracefuland lofty courtesy the chief of the Myrmidons rises from his seat, andlays his lyre aside, and welcomes his visitors. He will hear no messageuntil they have shared his hospitality. He brings them in, and sets themdown on couches spread with purple tapestry. Then, with the grandpatriarchal simplicity of the days of Abraham, when no office done for aguest was held to be servile, he bids Patroclus fill a larger bowl, andmix the wine strong, and make good preparation of the flesh of sheep,and goats, and well-fed swine. The great hero himself divides thecarcases, while his charioteer Automedon holds them. The joints arecooked above the heaped embers on ample spits under the superintendenceof Patroclus; and when all is ready, they fall to with that wholesomeappetite which has been the characteristic of most heroes in classicaland medieval times, Achilles carving for his guests, while Patroclusdeals out the bread. Professor Wilson’s remarks on the scene arecharacteristic:--“In nothing was the constitution of the heroes more enviable than itsnative power--of eating at all times, and without a moment’s warning.Never does a meal to any distinguished individual come amiss. Theirstomachs were as heroic as their hearts, their bowels magnanimous. Itcannot have been forgotten by the reader, who hangs with a wateringmouth over the description of this entertainment, that about two hoursbefore these three heroes, Ulysses, Ajax, and old Phœnix, had made analmost enormous supper in the pavilion of Agamemnon. But their walk    ‘Along the margin of the sounding deep’had reawakened their slumbering appetite.”In this respect, too, the heroes of the Carlovingian and Arthurianromances equal those of Homer--probably, indeed, taking their colourfrom his originals. Nay, a good capacity for food and drink seems initself to have been considered an heroic quality. When Sir Gareth ofOrkney sits him down at table, coming as a stranger to King Arthur’scourt, his performance as a trencher-man excites as much admiration ashis soldier-like thews and sinews. The company declare of himenthusiastically that “they never saw so goodly a man, nor so well ofhis eating.” And in the same spirit Sir Kay, Arthur’s foster-brother, issaid, in the Welsh legend, to “have drunk like four, and fought like ahundred.” The animal virtues are closely linked together; we stillprognosticate favourably of a horse’s powers of endurance if we seethat he is, like Sir Gareth, a good feeder. And perhaps it is somelingering reminiscence of the old heroic ages that leads us still tomark our appreciation of modern heroes by bestowing on them a publicdinner.When the meal is over, Ulysses rises, and in accordance with immemorialcustom--as old, it appears, as these half-mythical ages--pledges thehealth of their illustrious host. In a speech which does full justice tothe oratorical powers which the poet assigns him, he lays beforeAchilles the proposal of Agamemnon. He sets forth the straits to whichthe Greeks are reduced, pent within their fortifications by the terribleHector, and acknowledges, in the fullest manner, that in the great nameof Achilles lies their only hope of rescue. He dwells upon the remorsewhich Achilles himself will surely feel, when too late, if he suffersthe hopes of Greece to be ruined by the indulgence of his own haughtyspirit--the temper against which, as he reminds him, his aged fatherwarned him when first he set out for Troy:--    “My son, the boon of strength, if so they will,    Juno or Pallas have the power to give;    But thou thyself thy haughty spirit must curb,    For better far is gentle courtesy.”He lays before him the propositions of Agamemnon. Briseis shall berestored to him, in all honour, pure as when she left him; so the greatpoint in the quarrel is fully conceded. Moreover, the king will give himthe choice of his three daughters in marriage, if it ever be their happyfate to see again the shores of Argos, and will add such dowry    “As never man before to daughter gave.”And he will send, for the present, peace-offerings of royalmagnificence; ten talents of pure gold, seven fair Lesbian slaves, “wellskilled in household cares,” twelve horses of surpassing fleetness--theprizes they have already won would be in themselves a fortune--and sevenprosperous towns on the sea-coast of Argos. He adds, in well-conceivedclimax to his speech, an appeal to higher motives. If Achilles will notrelax his wrath against Agamemnon, at least let him have some compassionon the unoffending Greeks; let him bethink himself of the nationalhonour--of his own great name; shall Hector be allowed to boast, as hedoes now, that no Greek dares meet him in the field?But neither the eloquence of Ulysses, nor the garrulous pleading of hisold foster-father Phœnix, who indulges himself and his company withstories of Achilles’ boyhood, and of the exploits of his own youngerdays, can bend the iron determination of the hero. He will have none ofAgamemnon’s gifts, and none of Agamemnon’s daughters--no, not were theprincess as fair as Venus. Greece has store of fair maidens for him tochoose from if he will. Nay, had either woman or wealth been hisdelight, he had scarce come to Troy. He had counted the cost when he setout for the war:--    “Successful forays may good store provide;    And tripods may be gained, and noble steeds:    But when the breath of man hath passed his lips,    Nor strength, nor foray can the loss repair.    I by my goddess mother have been warned,    The silver-footed Thetis, that o’er me    A double chance of destiny impends:    If here remaining, round the walls of Troy    I wage the war, I ne’er shall see my home,    But then undying glory shall be mine:    If I return, and see my native land,    My glory all is gone; but length of life    Shall then be mine, and death be long deferred.” (D.)Besides, he adds with biting sarcasm, Agamemnon can have no need now ofhis poor services. He has built a wall, he hears,--with ditch andpalisade to boot: though he doubts whether, after all, it will keep outHector. To be sure, when _he_ was in the field, no wall was needed.Nor is he a whit more moved by the few blunt and soldier-like remarkswith which Ajax closes the conference. They may as well return, saysthat chief to Ulysses; words are lost upon one so obstinate as Achilles,who will neither listen to reason, nor cares for the love of his oldcompanions in arms. Ajax has no patience, either, with the romantic sideof the quarrel--    “And for a single girl! we offer seven.”Reproach and argument are alike in vain. The hero listens patiently andcourteously; but nothing shall move him from his resolution, unlessHector, the godlike, shall carry fire and sword even to the ships andtents of the Myrmidons; a venture which, he thinks, the Trojan prince,with all his hardihood, will pause before he makes.With downcast hearts the envoys return to Agamemnon; the aged Phœnixalone remaining behind, at Achilles’ special request, to accompany himwhen he shall set sail for home. Great consternation falls on theassembled chiefs when they learn the failure of their overtures; onlyDiomed, chivalrous as ever, laments that they should have stooped to askgrace at such a churlish hand. Let Achilles go or stay as he will: forthemselves--let every man refresh himself with food and wine--“fortherein do lie both strength and courage”--and then betake themselves totheir no less needful rest: ready, so soon as “the rosy-fingered dawn”appears, to set the battle fearlessly in array, in front of their shipsand tents, against this redoubtable Hector.But    “Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.”There is no rest for the King of Men, who has the fate of a nationalarmament on his soul. He looks forth upon the plain, where the thousandwatchfires of the enemy are blazing out into the night, and hears theconfused hum of their thick-lying battalions, and the sounds of the wildEastern music with which they are enlivening their revels, andcelebrating their victory by anticipation. He rises from his troubledcouch, determined to hold a night-council with Nestor and other chiefsof mark. He is donning his armour, when he is visited by his brotherMenelaus--for he too has no rest, thinking of the dire straits intowhich in his sole cause the armies of Greece are driven. The royalbrothers go in different directions through the camp, and quietly rouseall the most illustrious captains. Nestor is the guiding spirit in thecouncil, as before. He advises a reconnoissance of the enemy’s linesunder cover of the darkness. The office of a spy, be it remembered, wasreckoned in these old times, as in the days of the Hebrew commonwealth,a service of honour as well as of danger; and the kings and chiefs ofthe Greeks no more thought it beneath their dignity than Gideon did inthe case of the Midianites. The man who could discover for them thecounsels of Hector would win for himself not only a solid reward, but animmortal name--    “High as heaven in all men’s mouths    Should be his praise, and ample his reward;    For every captain of a ship should give    A coal-black ewe, and at her foot a lamb,    A prize beyond compare: and high should be    His place at banquets and at solemn feasts.”Diomed straightway volunteers for the adventure, and out of the manychiefs who offer themselves as his comrade, he chooses Ulysses. So--notwithout due prayer to Heaven--valour and subtlety go forth together ontheir perilous errand.Meanwhile the same idea has occurred to Hector; he too would learn thecounsels of his enemies. One Dolon--a young warrior who has a fine tastefor horses, but is otherwise of somewhat feminine type (Homer tells ushe was the only brother of five sisters), and whose main qualificationis fleetness of foot--is tempted to undertake the enterprise on asomewhat singular condition--that he shall have as his prize the morethan mortal horses of Achilles, when, as he doubts not will be soon thecase, the spoils of the conquered Greeks shall come to be divided. AndHector, with equal confidence, swears “by his sceptre” that they shallbe his and none other’s. Wrapped in a cloak of wolfskin, and wearing acap of marten’s fur instead of a helmet, he too steals out into thenight. He does not escape the keen vision of Ulysses. The Greek spiescrouch behind some dead bodies, and allow him to pass them, when theyrise and cut off his retreat to the Trojan camp. At first he thinks theyare Trojans, sent after him by Hector;     “But when they came a spear-cast off, or less,      He knew them for his foes, and slipt away      With lithe knees flying: and they behind him press.      As when with jaggèd teeth two dogs of prey      Hang steadily behind, to seize and slay,      Down the green woods, a wild fawn or a hare,      That shrieking flies them; on his track so lay      Odysseus and the son of Tydeus there,    Winding him out from Troy, and never swerved a hair.” (W.)Their aim is to take him alive. Diomed at last gets within an easyspear-cast--     “Then, hurling, he so ruled his aim, the spear      Whizzed by the neck, then sank into the ground.      He, trembling in his teeth, and white with fear,      Stood: from his mouth there came a chattering sound.      They panting, as he wept, his arms enwound.      ‘Take me alive, and sell me home,’ cried he;      ‘Brass, iron, and fine gold are with me found.      Glad will my father render countless fee,    If living by the ships they bear him news of me.’” (W.)Ulysses parleys with the unhappy youth, and drags from his terrifiedlips not only the secret of his errand, but the disposition of theTrojan forces,--most convenient information for their own movements.Especially, he tells them where they might find an easy prey, such ashis own soul would love. Rhesus, king of the Thracian allies, has hiscamp apart--          “No steeds that e’er I saw,    For size and beauty, can with his compare;    Whiter than snow, and swifter than the wind.”The unwilling treachery does not save his wretched life. Ulyssessarcastically admires his choice of a reward--   “High soared thy hopes indeed, that thought to win    The horses of Achilles; hard are they    For mortal man to harness or control,    Save for Achilles’ self, the goddess-born.”Then--with the cruel indifference to human life which marks every one ofHomer’s heroes--he severs his head from his body.Following the directions given by Dolon, the two Greeks make their wayfirst to the quarters of the Thracian contingent. Swiftly and silentlyDiomed despatches the king and twelve of his warriors, as they sleep,while Ulysses drives off the snow-white horses. With these trophies theyreturn safe to the Greek camp, where they are cordially welcomed, thoughit must be admitted they have gained but little insight into the designsof Hector.[19]CHAPTER VII.THE THIRD BATTLE.With the morrow’s dawn begins the third and great battle, at the Greeklines, which occupies from the eleventh to the eighteenth book of thepoem. Agamemnon is the hero of the earlier part of the day, and Hectoris warned by Jupiter not to hazard his own person in the battle, unlessthe Greek king is wounded; which at last he is, by the spear of a son ofAntenor. Ulysses and Diomed supply his place; until Paris, fighting insomewhat coward fashion, crouching behind the monumental stone of thenational hero Ilus, pins Diomed through the right heel to the groundwith an arrow. Ulysses stands manfully at bay almost alone amidst a hostof enemies, holding his ground, though he too is wounded, till Ajaxcomes to his aid. Still the Greeks have the worst of it. The skilfulleech Machaon, amongst others, is wounded by an arrow from the bow ofParis: till even Achilles, watching the fight from the lofty prow of hisship, sees his day of triumph and vengeance close at hand. He sendsPatroclus to the field--nominally to inquire who has just been carriedoff wounded, but with the further object, we may suppose, of learningthe state of the case more thoroughly. Nestor, to whose tent Patrocluscomes, begs him to use his influence now with his angry chief, andpersuade him, if not to come to the rescue in person, at least to sendhis stout Myrmidons to the aid of his countrymen, under Patroclus’ owncommand.Again the Greeks are driven within their intrenchments, and Hector andthe Trojan chariot-fighters pressing on them, attempt in their fierceexcitement even to make their horses leap the ditch and palisade. Foiledin this, they dismount, and, forming in five detachments under theseveral command of Hector, Helenus, Paris, Æneas, and Asius son ofHyrtacus, they attack the stockade at five points at once. Asius alonerefuses to quit his chariot; and choosing the quarter where a gate isstill left open to receive the Greek fugitives, he drives full at thenarrow entrance. But in that gateway on either hand stand two stalwartwarders, Leonteus and Polypates. The latter is the son of the mightyhero Pirithous, friend and comrade of Hercules, and both are of therenowned race of the Lapithæ. Gallantly the two champions keep thedangerous post against all comers, while their friends from the top ofthe rampart shower huge stones upon their assailants. Even Hector at hispoint of attack can make no impression: and as his followers vainlystrive to pass the ditch, an omen from heaven strikes them withapprehension as to the final issue. An eagle, carrying off a hugeserpent through the air, is bitten by the reptile, and drops it,writhing and bleeding, in the midst of the combatants. Polydamas pointsit out to Hector, and reads in it a warning that their victory will beat best a dearly-bought one. Hector rebukes him for his weakness inputting faith in portents. The noble words in which the poet sums upHector’s creed in such matters have passed into a proverb with patriotsof every age and nation--    “The best of omens is our country’s cause.”Sarpedon the Lycian, who claims none less than Jupiter for his father,has taken chief command of the Trojan auxiliaries, and, gallantlyseconded by his countryman Glaucus, sweeps “like a black storm” on thetower where Mnestheus, the Athenian, commands, and is like to havecarried it, when Glaucus falls wounded by an arrow from Teucer. Theslaughter is terrible on both sides, and the ditch and palisade are redwith blood. “The balance of the fight hangs even;” until at last theTrojan prince lifts a huge fragment of rock, and heaves it at the woodengates which bar the entrance at his point of attack.   “This way and that the severed portals flew    Before the crashing missile; dark as night    His low’ring brow, great Hector sprang within;    Bright flashed the brazen armour on his breast,    As through the gates, two javelins in his hand,    He sprang; the gods except, no power might meet    That onset; blazed his eyes with lurid fire.    Then to the Trojans, turning to the throng,    He called aloud to scale the lofty wall;    They heard, and straight obeyed; some scaled the wall;    Some through the strong-built gates continuous poured;    While in confusion irretrievable    Fled to their ships the panic-stricken Greeks.” (D.)Neptune has been watching the fight from the wooded heights ofSamothrace, and sees the imminent peril of his friends. “In four mightystrides”--the woods and mountains trembling beneath his feet--he reachesthe bay of Œge, in Achaia, where far in the depths lie his shiningpalaces of gold. There the sea-god mounts his chariot, yoking   “Beneath his car the brazen-footed steeds,    Of swiftest flight, with manes of flowing gold.    All clad in gold, the golden lash he grasped    Of curious work, and, mounting on his car,    Skimmed o’er the waves; from all the depths below    Gambolled around the monsters of the deep,    Acknowledging their king; the joyous sea    Parted her waves; swift flew the bounding steeds;    Nor was the brazen axle wet with spray,    When to the ships of Greece their lord they bore.” (D.)He takes the form of the soothsayer Calchas, and in his person ralliesthe discomfited Greeks, and summons the greater and the lesser Ajax tothe rescue. Both feel a sudden accession of new vigour and courage; AjaxOileus detects the divinity of their visitor, as the seeming Calchasturns to depart. The two chiefs quickly gather round them a phalanx oftheir comrades.   “Spear close by spear, and shield by shield o’erlaid,    Buckler to buckler pressed, and helm to helm,    And man to man; the horse-hair plumes above,    That nodded on the warriors’ glittering crests,    Each other touched, so closely massed they stood.    Backward by many a stalwart hand were drawn    The spears, in act to hurl; their eyes and minds    Turned to the front, and eager for the fray.” (D.)Hector’s career is stayed. Ajax the Lesser brings into play his band ofLocrian bowmen, of little use in the open field, but good when they areunder cover.                “Theirs were not the hearts    To brook th’ endurance of the standing fight;    Nor had they brass-bound helms with horse-hair plume,    Nor ample shields they bore, nor ashen spear,    But came to Troy in bows and twisted slings    Of woollen cloth confiding.”The galling storm of their arrows throws confusion into the Trojanranks. Helenas and Deiphobus, Hector’s brothers, have already been ledoff wounded: Asius son of Hyrtacus has found his trust in chariot andhorses vain, and lies dead within the Greek lines. But Hector stillpresses on, and Paris shows that he can play the soldier on occasion assuccessfully as the gallant. The Greeks, too, miss their leaders.Agamemnon, Ulysses, Diomed, are all disabled for the time. The twoAjaxes and Idomeneus of Crete do all that man can do. But the stockadehas been forced, and the fight is now round the ships,--the last hope ofbare safety for the Greek forces. If Hector burns them, as he boasts hewill, all means of retreat, all the long-cherished prospect of seeingtheir homes again, are lost to them. In a hasty conference with hiswounded companions beside his galley, Agamemnon, suffering anddispirited, once more counsels retreat before it be too late. If theycan but hold out till nightfall, then, under cover of the darkness, heproposes to take the sea. Those vessels which lie close to the shore maybe launched at once without discovery from the enemy, and kept out atanchor: the rest can follow when the Trojans have, as usual, withdrawnfrom immediate attack, as soon as the shades of evening make thedistinction hazardous between friend and foe. Ulysses and Diomedoverrule the proposal; and the wounded leaders return to the scene ofcombat, unable to take an active part, but inspiriting their men fromsafe posts of observation.The interlude of comedy is furnished again by the denizens of Olympus.Juno has watched with delight the successful efforts of Neptune to rallythe Greeks against Hector and the hateful Trojans; but she is in anagony of apprehension lest Jupiter, who has his attention just nowoccupied in Thrace, should interfere at this critical moment, and stillgrant the victory to Hector. She determines to put in force all herpowers of blandishment, and to coax the Thunderer to spend in hercompany those precious hours which are laden with the fate of herGreeks. She is not content with her ordinary powers of fascination: sheapplies to the goddess of love for the loan of her magic girdle,--   “Her broidered cestus, wrought with every charm    To win the heart; there Love, there young Desire,    There fond Discourse, and there Persuasion dwelt,    Which oft enthrals the mind of wisest men.”It certainly enthrals the mind of the sovereign of Olympus; who, in allcases where female attractions were concerned, was even as the mostfoolish of mortals. Transfigured by the cestus of Venus, his queenappears to him in a halo of celestial charms which are irresistible. Inher company he speedily forgets the wretched squabbles of the creaturesupon earth. Juno has bribed the god of sleep also to become heraccomplice; and the dread king is soon locked in profound repose.Then Neptune seizes his opportunity, and heads the Greeks in person.Agamemnon, disregarding his recent wound, is seen once more in the frontof the battle. Ajax meets Hector hand to hand, receives his spear fullin his breast just where his cross-belts meet, and so escapes unwounded.As the Trojan prince draws back to recover himself, the giant Greekupheaves a huge stone that has shored up one of the galleys, and hurlsit with main strength against his breast. “Like an oak of the foreststruck by lightning” Hector falls prone in the dust. With shouts ofexultation, Ajax and his comrades rush to crown their victory bystripping his armour; but the great chiefs of the enemy,--Æneas,Polydamas, the Lycian captains Sarpedon and Glaucus--gather round andlock their shields in front of the fallen hero, while others bear himaside out of the battle, still in a death-like swoon, to where hischariot stands. Dismayed at the fall of their great leader, the Trojansgive ground; the trench is recrossed, and the Greeks breathe again.Jupiter awakes from sleep just in time to see the mischief that has beendone; the Trojans in flight, the Greeks with Neptune at their headpursuing; Hector lying senseless by the side of his chariot, stillbreathing heavily, and vomiting blood from his bruised chest, andsurrounded by his anxious comrades. He turns wrathfully upon Juno--it isher work, he knows. He reminds her of former penalties which she hadbrought upon herself by deceiving him.   “Hast thou forgotten how in former times    I hung thee from on high, and to thy feet    Attached two ponderous anvils, and thy hands    With golden fetters bound which none might break?    There didst thou hang amid the clouds of heaven:    Through all Olympus’ breadth the gods were wroth;    Yet dared not one approach to set thee free.” (D.)He does not proceed, however, to exercise any such barbarous conjugaldiscipline on this occasion, and is readily appeased by his queen’sassurance that the interference of Neptune was entirely on his ownproper motion. He condescends even to explain why he desires to give atemporary triumph to the Trojans: it is that, in accordance with hissworn promise to Thetis, he may avenge the insult offered to her sonAchilles, by teaching the Greeks their utter helplessness without him.The Goddess of the Rainbow is sent to warn Neptune, on pain of theThunderer’s displeasure, to quit the fight. The sea-king demurs. “Wasnot a fair partition made, in the primeval days, between the threebrother-gods, of the realms of Air, and Sea, and Darkness? and is notEarth common ground to all? Why is not Jupiter content with his ownlawful domains, and by what right does he assume to dictate to abrother--and a brother-king?” Iris, however, calms him; he is perfectlyright in theory, she admits; but in practice he will find his elderbrother too strong for him. So the sea-god, in sulky acquiescence,leaves the scene of battle, and plunges down into the depths of his owndominion. Phœbus Apollo, on the other hand, receives Jupiter’spermission to aid the Trojans. He sweeps down from Olympus to the spotwhere Hector lies, now slowly reviving. The hero recognises hiscelestial visitor, and feels at once his strength restored, and hisardour for the battle reawakened. To the consternation of the Greeks, hereappears in the field, fierce and vigorous as before. But he no longercomes alone; in his front moves Phœbus Apollo,--   “His shoulders veiled in cloud; his arm sustained    The awful Ægis, dread to look on, hung    With shaggy tassels round and dazzling bright,    Which Vulcan, skilful workman, gave to Jove,    To scatter terror ’mid the souls of men.” (D.)When the sun-god flashes this in the faces of the Greeks, heart andspirit fail them. Stalking in the van of the Trojans, he leads them uponce more against the embankment, and, planting his mighty foot uponit, levels a wide space for the passage of the chariots,--   “Easy, as when a child upon the beach,    In wanton play, with hands and feet o’erthrows    The mound of sand which late in sport he raised.”The habits and pursuits of grown-up men change with the passinggeneration; but the children of Homer’s day might play with our own, andunderstand each other’s ways perfectly.Chariots and footmen press through the breach pell-mell, and again thebattle rages round the Greek galleys. Standing on their high decks, theGreeks maintain the struggle gallantly with the long boarding-pikes, aswe should call them, kept on board for use in such emergencies. Ajax’galley is attacked by Hector in person; but the Greek chief standsdesperately at bay, wielding a huge pike thirty-three feet long, and hisbrother Teucer plies his arrows with fatal effect upon the crowdedassailants: until Jupiter, alarmed lest Hector should be struck, snapshis bowstring in sunder. Hector calls loudly for fire to burn thevessels, and one warrior after another, torch in hand, makes the attemptat the cost of his life, until twelve lie biting the sand, slain by thehuge weapon of Ajax.CHAPTER VIII.THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS.Patroclus, sitting in the tent of the wounded Eurypylus, sees theimminent peril of his countrymen. He cannot bear the sight, and takinghasty leave of his friend, hurries back to the quarters of Achilles, andstands before him in an agony of silent tears. At first the hero affectsto chide his follower for such girlish sorrow--what cares he for theGreeks? It is plain, however, that he does care; and when Patroclus, invery outspoken terms, upbraids him for his obduracy, and asks that, evenif the dark doom that hangs over him makes his chief unwilling to takethe field in person, he will at least send him with the Myrmidons to therescue, Achilles at once consents. Patroclus shall go, clad in hisarmour, that so perchance the Trojans may be deceived, and think thatthey see the well-known crest of Achilles himself once more leading thefight. Only he warns him not to advance too far; to be content withrescuing the galleys, and not attempt to press his victory home to thewalls of Troy; in that case he will find the gods of the enemy turntheir wrath against him. In spite of his assumed indifference, Achillesis intently watching the combatants in the distance, and sees theflames rising in the air from the galley of Ajax. He can no longerrestrain his feelings, but hurries his comrade forth. Patroclus puts onthe harness of his chief, and takes his sword and shield: only themighty spear he forbears to touch;--   “None save Achilles’ self that spear could poise,    The far-famed Pelian ash, which to his sire,    On Pelion’s summit felled, to be the bane    Of mightiest chiefs, the centaur Chiron gave.”He mounts the hero’s chariot, driven by the noble Automedon, and drawnby the three horses, Xanthus, Balius, and Pedasus--or as we should callthem, Chestnut, Dapple, and Swift-foot. The battalions of the Myrmidonseagerly gather round their leaders,--even old Phœnix taking command ofone detachment. Achilles himself gives them a few fiery words ofexhortation. “They have long chafed at their enforced idleness, andclamoured for the battle; lo! there lies the opportunity they havelonged for.” Then, standing in the midst, he pours from his most costlygoblet the solemn libation to Jove, and prays of him for Patroclusvictory and a safe return. The poet tells us, with that licence ofprognostication which has been considerably abused by some modernwriters of fiction, that half the prayer was heard, and half denied.“Like a pack of ravening wolves, hungering for their prey,” theMyrmidons launch themselves against the enemy. The Trojans recognise, asthey believe, in the armed charioteer who heads them, the terribleAchilles, and consternation spreads through their ranks. Even Hector,though still fighting gallantly, is borne back over the stockade, andthe ditch is filled with broken chariots and struggling horses. Backtowards the Trojan lines rolls the tide of battle. Sarpedon, the greatLycian chief, own son to Jupiter, falls by the spear of Patroclus. Theruler of Olympus has hesitated for a while whether he shall interpose tosave him; but his fated term of life is come, and there is a mysteriousDestiny in this Homeric mythology, against which even Jupiter seemspowerless. All that he can do for his offspring is to insure for hisbody the rites of burial; and by his order the twin brothers, Sleep andDeath, carry off the corpse to his native shore of Lycia.But Patroclus has forgotten the parting caution of Achilles. Flushedwith his triumph, he follows up the pursuit even to the walls of Troy.But there Apollo keeps guard. Thrice the Greek champion in defiancesmites upon the battlements, and thrice the god shakes the terrible Ægisin his face. A fourth time the Greek lifts his spear, when an awfulvoice warns him that neither for him, nor yet for his mightier masterAchilles, is it written in the fates to take Troy. Awe-struck, he drawsback from the wall, but only to continue his career of slaughter amongthe Trojans. Apollo meets him in the field, strips from him his helmetand his armour, and shivers his spear in his hand. The Trojan Euphorbus,seeing him at this disadvantage, stabs him from behind, and Hector,following him as he retreats, drives his spear through his body. As theTrojan prince stands over his victim, exulting after the fashion of allHomeric heroes in what seems to our taste a barbarous and boastfulspirit, Patroclus with his dying breath foretells that his slayer shallspeedily meet his own fate by the avenging hand of Achilles. Hectorspurns the prophecy, and rushes after the charioteer Automedon, whomthe immortal horses carry off safe from his pursuit. Then donning thearmour of Achilles, so lately worn by Patroclus, he leads on the Trojansto seize the dead body, which Menelaus is gallantly defending. After along and desperate contest, the Greeks, locking their shields togetherin close phalanx, succeed in carrying it off, the two Ajaxes keeping theassailants at bay. Jupiter, in pity to the dead hero, casts a veil ofdarkness round him. But this embarrasses the movements of friends aswell as enemies, and gives rise to a characteristic outburst on the partof Ajax, often quoted. He can fight best when he sees his way. “Give usbut light, O Jove, and in the light, if thou seest fit, destroy us!”We have now reached the crisis of the story. The wrath of Achillesagainst Agamemnon wanes and pales before the far more bitter wrath whichnow fills his whole soul against Hector, as the slayer of his comrade.Young Antilochus, son of Nestor, brings the mournful tidings to histent, where he sits already foreboding the result, as he sees the Greekscrowding back to their galleys from the field in front of Troy. Hisgrief is frantic--he tears his hair, and heaps dust upon his head, aftera fashion which strongly suggests the Eastern character of the tale. Hisgoddess-mother, Thetis “of the silver feet,” hears him,   “Beside her aged father where she sat,    In the deep ocean-caves,”and comes with all her train of sea-nymphs to console him, as whenbefore he sat weeping with indignation at the insult of Agamemnon. Invain she strives to comfort him with the thought that his insultedhonour has been fully satisfied--that the Greeks have bitterly ruedtheir former treatment of him. He feels only the loss of Patroclus, andcurses the hour in which he was born. All that he longs for now isvengeance upon Hector. Thetis sorrowfully reminds him that it is writtenin the book of fate that when Hector falls, his own last hour is near athand. Be it so, is his reply--death comes in turn to all men, and hewill meet it as he may. But he cannot go forth to battle without armour;and the goddess promises that by the morrow’s dawn, Vulcan, the immortalcraftsman, shall furnish him with harness of proof.The Greeks have fought their way to their vessels, step by step, withthe dead body of Patroclus. But Hector with his Trojans has pressed themclose all the way, and even when at the Greek lines seizes the corpse bythe feet. Iris flies to Achilles with a message from Juno--will he seehis dead friend given as a prey to the dogs and vultures?--He is withoutarmour, true; but there is no need for him to adventure himself amongthe combatants; let him only show himself, let the Trojans but hear hisvoice, and it is enough. He does so; standing aloft upon the rampart,while Pallas throws her ægis over him, and surrounds his head with ahalo of flashing light, he lifts his mighty voice and thrice shoutsaloud. Panic seizes the whole host of Troy, and while they give groundin dismay, the dead Patroclus is borne off to the tent of Achilles.Night falls on the plain, and separates the combatants. The Trojans,before their evening meal, hold an anxious council, in which Polydamas,as great in debate as Hector is in the field, advises that they shouldnow retire within their walls. Achilles, it is evident, will head theGreeks in the morning, and who shall stand before him? But the wisecounsel of Polydamas meets the same fate as that of Ahithophel; Heavenwill not suffer men to listen to it. Minerva perverts the understandingsof the Trojans, and they prefer the rasher exhortations of Hector, whourges them at all hazards to keep the field.Thetis, meanwhile, has sought out Vulcan, and bespoken his skill in theforging of new armour for her son. The lame god will work for her, sheknows; for in the day when his cruel mother Juno, in wrath at hismarvellous ugliness, cast him down from Olympus, she with hersister-goddess Eurynome had nursed him in their bosom till he grewstrong. She finds him now hard at work at his forges, in the brazenhalls which he has made for himself in heaven. He is completing at thismoment some marvellous machinery--twenty tripods mounted on wheels ofgold (the earliest hint of velocipedes), which are to move ofthemselves, and carry him to and fro to the assembly of the gods.Another marvel, too, is to be seen in the Fire-king’s establishment,which has long been the desideratum of modern households, but whichmodern mechanical science has as yet failed to invent--automatonservants, worked by machinery.   “In form as living maids, but wrought in gold,    Instinct with consciousness, with voice endued,    And strength, and skill from heavenly teachers drawn;    These waited duteous at the monarch’s side.”Willingly, at the request of the sea-goddess, Vulcan plies his immortalart. Helmet with crest of gold, breastplate “brighter than the flash offire,” and the pliant greaves that mould themselves to the limb, aresoon completed. But the marvel of marvels is the shield. On this thegod bestows all his skill, and the, poet his most graphic description.It is covered with figures of the most elaborate design, wrought inbrass, and tin, and gold, and silver. In its centre are the sun, themoon, and all the host of heaven: round the rim flows the mightyocean-river, which in Homeric as in Eastern mythology encompasses theearth; and on its embossed surface, crowded with figures, is embodied anepitome of human life, such as life was in the days of Homer. The taleis told in twelve compartments, containing each a scene of peace or war.Three groups represent a city in time of peace: a wedding processionwith music and dancing, a dispute in the market-place, and a referenceto the judgment of the elders gathered in council. Three represent acity in time of war: a siege, an ambuscade, and a battle. Then followthree scenes of outdoor country life: ploughing, the harvest, and thevintage. The lord of the harvest stands looking on at his reapers, likeBoaz. In the vintage scene, the art of the immortal workman is minutelydescribed. The vines are wrought in gold, the props are of silver, thegrape-bunches are of a purple black, and there is a trench round of somedark-hued metal, crowned by a palisade of bright tin. Three pastoralgroups complete the circle. First, a herd of oxen with herdsmen andtheir dogs, attacked by lions; secondly, flocks feeding in a deepvalley, with the folds and shepherds’ huts in the distance; and lastly,a festival dance of men and maidens in holiday attire, with the “divinebard,” without whom no festival is complete, singing his lays to hisharp in the midst, and two gymnasts performing their feats for theamusement of the crowd of lookers-on. If any reader should have imaginedthat Homer’s song of (it may be) three thousand years ago was rude andinartistic, he has but to read, in the version of any of our besttranslators, this description of the Shield of Achilles, to be convincedthat the poet understood his work to the full as well as the immortalcraftsman whom he represents as having wrought it. We need not troubleourselves with the difficulty of that French critic, who doubted whetherso many subjects could really be represented on any shield of manageablesize--like Goldsmith’s rustics who marvelled, in the case of the villageschoolmaster,    “That one small head could carry all he knew.”It is only necessary to point to the clever design of Flaxman for itsrealisation, and its actual embodiment (with the moderate diameter ofthree feet) in the shield cast by Pitts.CHAPTER IX.THE RETURN OF ACHILLES.With a fierce delight Achilles gazes on the work of the Olympianarmourer, before the dazzling brightness of which even the Myrmidonsveil their faces. He sets forth at once for the tents of Agamemnon; and,taking his way along the shore, calls the leaders to battle as he passeseach man’s galley. The news of his coming spreads fast and far, andevery man, from the highest to the lowest, even those who never quittedthe ship on any other occasion--   “The steersmen who the vessels’ rudders hold,    The very stewards who served the daily bread”--flock to the central rendezvous to welcome back the champion of theAchæans. He is as impulsive and outspoken in his reconciliation as inhis wrath. There is no need of mediation now between himself andAgamemnon. He accosts the king with a noble simplicity:   “Great son of Atreus, what hath been the gain    To thee or me, since heart-consuming strife    Hath fiercely raged between us, for a girl--    Who would to heaven had died by Dian’s shafts    That day when from Lyrnessus’ captured town    I bore her off, so had not many a Greek    Bitten the bloody dust, by hostile hands    Subdued, while I in anger stood aloof.    Great was the gain to Troy; but Greece, methinks,    Will long retain the memory of our feud.    Yet pass we that; and though our hearts be sore,    Still let us school our angry spirits down.    My wrath I here abjure.” (D.)Agamemnon, for his part, magnanimously admits his error; laying thechief blame, however, upon Jupiter and Fate, who blinded the eyes of hisunderstanding. The peace-offerings are produced and accepted, thoughAchilles only chafes at anything which can delay his vengeance. Ulyssesstrongly urges the necessity of a substantial meal for the whole army;   “For none throughout the day till set of sun,    Fasting from food, may bear the toils of war;    His spirit may be eager for the fray,    Yet are his limbs by slow degrees weighed down.”Achilles schools himself into patience while the rest act upon thisprosaic but prudent counsel; but for himself, he will neither eat nordrink, nor wash his blood-stained hands, till he has avenged the deathof his comrade. So he sits apart in his grief, while the rest are at thebanquet: Minerva, by Jupiter’s command, infusing into his body ambrosiaand nectar, to sustain his strength. Another true mourner is Briseis.The first sight which meets the captive princess on her return to theMyrmidon camp is the bloody corpse of Patroclus. She throws herself uponit in an agony of tears. He, in the early days of her captivity, hadspoken kind and cheering words, and had been a friend in time oftrouble. So, too, Menelaus briefly says of him--“He knew how to be kindto all men.” This glimpse which the poet gives us of the gentlerfeatures of the dead warrior’s character is touching enough, when weremember the utter disregard of an enemy’s or a captive’s feelings shownnot only by Homer’s heroes, but by those of the older Jewish Scriptures.When all is ready for the battle, Achilles dons the armour of Vulcan,and draws from its case the Centaur’s gift,--the ashen spear of MountPelion, which even Patroclus, it will be remembered, had not ventured totake in hand. Thus armed, he mounts his chariot, drawn by the twoimmortal steeds, Xanthus and Balius--for their mortal yoke-fellow hadbeen slain in the battle in which Patroclus fell. As he mounts, in thebitter spirit which leads him to blame the whole world for the death ofhis friend, he cannot forbear a taunt to his horses--he trusts they willnot leave him on the field, as they left Patroclus. Then the chestnut,inspired by Juno, for once finds a human voice, and exculpates himselfand his comrade. It was no fault of theirs; it was the doom ofPatroclus, and Achilles’ own doom draws nigh. This day they will bringhim back in safety; but the end is at hand.Unlike Hector, Achilles knows and foresees his doom clearly; but, likeHector, he will meet it unflinchingly. Pope’s version of his reply isdeservedly admired. Xanthus has uttered his warning;   “Then ceased for ever, by the Furies tied,    His fateful voice. Th’ intrepid chief replied    With unabated rage--‘So let it be!    Portents and prodigies are lost on me;    I know my fate; to die, to see no more    My much-loved parents and my native shore;    Enough--when Heaven ordains, I sink in night;    Now perish Troy!’ he said, and rushed to fight.”In the renewed battle which ensues, the gods, by express permission oftheir sovereign, take part. Juno, Neptune, Minerva, Mercury, and Vulcanassist the Greeks: Mars, Venus, Apollo, Latona, and Diana join theTrojans. Their interference seems, at least to our modern taste, toassist in no way the action of the poem, and merely tends to weaken forthe time the human interest. We must be content to assume that upon aGreek audience the impression was different. The only effect which theseimmortal allies produce upon the fortunes of the day is a negative one;Apollo incites Æneas to encounter Achilles, and when he is in imminentdanger, Neptune conveys him away in a mist. Apollo performs the sameoffice for Hector, who also engages the same terrible adversary, in thehope of avenging upon him the death of his young brother Polydorus.Disappointed in both his greater antagonists, Achilles vents his wrathin indiscriminate slaughter. Driving through the disordered host of theTrojans, his chariot wheels and axle steeped in blood, he cuts the massof fugitives in two, and drives part of them into the shallows of theriver Scamander. Leaping down from his chariot, he wades into the river,and there continues his career of slaughter, sword in hand. TwelveTrojan youths he takes alive and hands them over to his followers;sparing them for the present only to slay them hereafter as victims atthe funeral-pile to appease the shade of Patroclus. Another suppliantfor his mercy has a singular history. The young Lycaon, one of the manysons of Priam, had been taken prisoner by him in one of his raids uponTrojan territory, and sold as a slave in Lemnos. He had been ransomedthere and sent home to Troy, only twelve days before he fell into hisenemy’s hands again here in the bed of the Scamander. Achillesrecognises him, and cruelly taunts him with his reappearance: the deadTrojans whom he has slain will surely next come to life again, if thecaptives thus cross the seas to swell the ranks of his enemies. In vainLycaon pleads for his life, that he is not the son of the same mother asHector--that his brother Polydorus has just been slain, which may wellcontent the Greek’s vengeance. There is a gloomy irony in the words withwhich Achilles rejects his prayer. Before Patroclus fell, he had sparedmany a Trojan; but henceforth, all appeal to his mercy is vain--most ofall from a son of Priam. But, in fact, the wish to escape one’s fate heholds to be utterly unreasonable;   “Thou too, my friend, must die--why vainly wail?    Dead is Patroclus too, thy better far--    Me too thou seest, how stalwart, tall, and fair,    Of noble sire and goddess-mother born,    Yet must I yield to death and stubborn fate,    Whene’er, at morn or noon or eve, the spear    Or arrow from the bow may reach my life.” (D.)At last the great river-god--whom the gods call Xanthus, but menScamander--rises in his might, indignant at seeing his stream chokedwith corpses, and stained with blood. He hurls the whole force of hiswaves against Achilles, and the hero is fain to save himself by graspingan elm that overhangs the bank, and so swinging himself to land. Buthere Scamander pursues him, and, issuing from his banks, rolls in adeluge over the plain. Even the soul of Achilles is terror-stricken atthis new aspect of death. Is he to die thus, like some vile churl--    “Borne down in crossing by a wintry brook?”Neptune and Minerva appear to encourage him, and give him strength tobattle with the flood: and when Scamander summons his brother-riverSimois to his aid, Vulcan sends flames that scorch all the river-banks,consuming the trees and shrubs that clothe them, and threatening to dryup the very streams themselves. The river yields, and retires to hisbanks, leaving Achilles free to pursue his victories. He drives theTrojans inside their walls, and but that Apollo guards the gates, wouldhave entered the city in hot pursuit. Hector alone remains without--hisdoom is upon him.The gods, meanwhile, have entered the field of battle on their ownaccount, and contributed, as before, a ludicrous element to the actionof the poem. Minerva fells Mars the war-god to the ground with a hugemass of rock, an ancient landmark, which she hurls against him; and helies covering “above seven hundred feet,” till Venus comes to his aid tolead him from the field, when the terrible goddess strikes her to theearth beside him. Juno shows the strength of those “white arms” whichthe poet always assigns to her, by a terrible buffet which she bestows,for no particular reason apparently, upon Diana, who drops her bow andloses her arrows, and flies weeping to her father Jupiter. He, for hispart, has been watching the quarrels of his court and family with adignified amusement;--   “Jove as his sport the dreadful scene descries,    And views contending gods with careless eyes.” (P.)Those philosophers who see a moral allegory in the whole of the Homericstory, have supplied us with a key to the conduct and feelings ofJupiter during this curious combat. “Jupiter, as the lord of nature, iswell pleased with the war of the gods--that is, of earth, sea, air,&c.--because the harmony of all beings arises from that discord. Thusheat and cold, moist and dry, are in a continual war, yet upon thisdepends the fertility of the earth and the beauty of the creation. Sothat Jupiter, who, according to the Greeks, is the soul of all, may wellbe said to smile at this contention.”[20] Those readers who may not besatisfied with this solution must be content to take the burlesque as itstands.CHAPTER X.THE DEATH OF HECTOR.Hector remains alone outside the Scæan gate, awaiting his great enemy.In vain his aged father and mother from the walls entreat him to takeshelter within, like the rest of his countrymen. He will not meet thejust reproach of Polydamas, whose prudent counsel he rejected. Thedeaths of his friends who have fallen in this terrible battle, which hehad insisted upon their risking, hang heavy on his soul. He, at least,will do what he may for Troy. Yet he has no confidence in the result ofthe encounter. If he were only sure that Achilles would listen, he wouldeven now offer to restore Helen, and so end this disastrous war. But hefeels it is too late; vengeance alone will now content Achilles.   “Not this the time, nor he the man with whom    By forest oak or rock, like youth and maid,    To hold light talk as youth and maid might hold.    Better to dare the fight, and know at once    For whom the vict’ry is decreed by Heaven.”Achilles draws near. The courage which has never failed Hector before,wholly deserts him now; he turns and flies, “like a dove from thefalcon.” Judged by any theory of modern heroism, his conduct is simplyindefensible. Critics tell us that the poet, in order to enhance theglory of his chief hero, makes even the champion of Troy fear to facehim. But it is no compliment, in our modern eyes, to a victoriouswarrior, to have it explained that his crowning victory was won over acoward. Yet perhaps there was something of this feeling maintained evenby Englishmen in days not so very long gone by, when it was the popularfashion to represent Frenchmen generally, and the great French generalin particular, as always running away from the English bayonets.However, to Homer’s public it was evidently not incongruous orderogatory to the heroic type of character, that sudden panic shouldseize even the bravest in the presence of superior force. Hector, as hasbeen said, turns and flies for his life.Thrice round the walls of the city, his friends looking on in horror atthe terrible race, he flies, with Achilles in pursuit. In each course hetries to reach the gates, that his comrades may either open to him, orat least cover him by launching their missiles from the walls againsthis enemy. But still Achilles turns him back towards the plain, signingto the Greeks to hurl no spear, nor to interfere in any way with hissingle vengeance. The gods look down from Olympus with divided interest.Jupiter longs to save him; but Minerva sternly reminds him of the dreaddestiny--the Eternal Law--which even the Ruler of Olympus is bound toreverence. Once more he lifts in heaven the golden scales, and findsthat Hector’s fate weighs down the balance. Then, at last, his guardianApollo leaves him. Minerva, on her part, comes to the aid of herfavourite Achilles with a stratagem, as little worthy of his renown (toour view) as the sudden panic of Hector. She appears by the side of theTrojan hero in the likeness of his brother Deiphobus, and bids him standand fight; they two, together, must surely be a match for Achilles.Hector turns and challenges his adversary. One compact he tries to make,in a few hurried words, before they encounter; let each promise, sinceone must fall, to restore the dead body of his enemy in all honour tohis kindred. Achilles makes no reply but this:--   “Talk not to me of compacts; as ’tween men    And lions no firm concord can exist,    Nor wolves and lambs in harmony unite,    But ceaseless enmity between them dwells:    So not in friendly terms, nor compact firm,    Can thou and I unite, till one of us    Glut with his blood the mail-clad warrior Mars.    Mind thee of all thy fence; behoves thee now    To prove a spearman skilled, and warrior brave.    For thee escape is none; now, by my spear,    Hath Pallas doomed thy death: my comrade’s blood,    Which thou hast shed, shall all be now avenged.” (D.)The spear launched with these words misses its mark: that of Hectorstrikes full in the centre of his enemy’s shield, but it glancesharmlessly off from the fire-god’s workmanship. He looks round forDeiphobus to hand him another; but the false Deiphobus has vanished,and, too late, Hector detects the cruel deceit of the goddess. He willdie at least as a hero should. He draws his sword, and rushes onAchilles. The wary Greek eyes him carefully as he comes on, and spiesthe joint in his harness where the breastplate meets the throat. Throughthat fatal spot he drives his spear, and the Trojan falls to the groundmortally wounded, but yet preserving the power of speech. As hisconqueror stands over him cruelly vaunting, and vowing to give his bodyto the dogs and to the vultures, he makes a last appeal to his mercy.“By the heads of his parents” he beseeches him to spare this lastindignity; the ransom which his father Priam will offer shall be amplefor one poor corpse. But the wrath of Achilles has become for thepresent mere savage madness. Neither prayer nor ransom shall avail inthis matter. Hector’s last words are prophetic:--          “I know thee well, nor did I hope    To change thy purpose; iron is thy soul.    But see that on thy head I bring not down    The wrath of heaven, when by the Scæan gate    The hand of Paris, with Apollo’s aid,    Brave warrior as thou art, shall strike thee down.” (D.)The only glimpse of nobility which Achilles shows throughout the wholescene is in his stoical answer:--   “Die thou! my fate I then shall meet, whene’er    Jove and th’ immortal gods shall so decree.”What follows is mere brutality. The Greeks crowd round, and drive theirweapons into the senseless body.   “And one to other looked, and said, ‘Good faith,    Hector is easier far to handle now,    Than when erewhile he wrapped our ships in fire.’”Does it need here to do more than recall the too well rememberedsequel--how the savage victor pierced the heels of his dead enemy, andso fastened the body to his chariot, and dragged him off to his ships,in full sight of his agonised parents? how   “A cloud of dust the trailing body raised;    Loose hung his glossy hair; and in the dust    Was laid that noble head, so graceful once.”Or how the miserable Priam, grovelling on the floor of his palace,besought his weeping friends to suffer him to rush out of the gates, andimplore the mercy of the merciless Achilles? Less horrible, if not lesspiteous, is the picture of Andromache:--                        “To her no messenger    Had brought the tidings, that without the walls    Remained her husband; in her house withdrawn,    A web she wove, all purple, double woof,    With varied flowers in rich embroidery,    And to her neat-haired maids she gave command    To place the largest caldrons on the fires,    That with warm baths, returning from the fight,    Hector might be refreshed; unconscious she,    That by Achilles’ hand, with Pallas’ aid,    Far from the bath, was godlike Hector slain.    The sounds of wailing reached her from the tower.           *       *       *       *       *    Then from the house she rushed, like one distract,    With beating heart; and with her went her maids.    But when the tower she reached, where stood the crowd,    And mounted on the wall, and looked around,    And saw the body trailing in the dust,    Which the fleet steeds were dragging to the ships,    A sudden darkness overspread her eyes;    Backward she fell, and gasped her spirit away.    Far off were flung th’ adornments of her head,    The net, the fillet, and the woven bands;    The nuptial veil by golden Venus given,    That day when Hector of the glancing helm    Led from Eëtion’s house his wealthy bride.    The sisters of her husband round her pressed,    And held, as in the deadly swoon she lay.” (D.)The body is dragged off to the ships, and flung in the dust in front ofthe bier on which Patroclus lies. And now, at last, when he has beenfully avenged, the due honours shall be paid to his beloved remains,while the dogs and vultures feast on those of Hector. Thrice in slowprocession, with a mournful chant, the Myrmidons lead their horsesround the bier. While Achilles sleeps the deep sleep of exhaustion afterthe long day’s battle, the shade of his dead friend appears to him, andchides him for leaving him so long unburied, a wandering ghost in thegloom below.   “Sleep’st thou, Achilles, mindless of thy friend,    Neglecting not the living, but the dead?    Hasten my fun’ral rites, that I may pass    Through Hades’ gloomy gates; ere those be done,    The spirits and spectres of departed men    Drive me far from them, nor allow to cross    Th’ abhorred river; but forlorn and sad    I wander through the widespread realms of night.    And give me now thy hand, whereon to weep;    For never more, when laid upon the pyre,    Shall I return from Hades; never more,    Apart from all our comrades, shall we two,    As friends, sweet counsel take; for me, stern Death,    The common lot of man, has ope’d his mouth;    Thou too, Achilles, rival of the gods,    Art destined here beneath the walls of Troy    To meet thy doom; yet one thing must I add,    And make, if thou wilt grant it, one request:    Let not my bones be laid apart from thine,    Achilles, but together, as our youth    Was spent together in thy father’s house.” (D.)As eager now to do honour to Achilles as he was before to insult him,Agamemnon has despatched a strong force at early dawn to cut down woodfor a huge funeral pile. The burial rites are grandly savage. In longprocession and in full panoply the Myrmidons bear the dead hero to thepile, and the corpse is covered with the long locks of hair which everywarrior in turn, Achilles first, cuts off as an offering to the godsbelow. Four chariot-horses, and two dogs “that had fed at their master’sboard,” are slain upon the pile, to follow him, in case he should haveneed of them, into the dark and unknown country: and last, the twelveTrojan captives, according to his barbarous vow, are slaughtered byAchilles in person, and laid upon the pile. The winds of heaven aresolemnly invoked to fan the flames, which roar and blaze all night; andall night Achilles pours copious libations of wine from a golden goblet.With wine also the embers are quenched in the morning, and the bones ofPatroclus are carefully collected and placed in a golden urn, to awaitthe day, which Achilles foresees close at hand, when they shall beburied under one mound with his own.There follow the funeral games. First, the chariot-race, in which Diomedcarries off an easy victory with the Trojan horses which he capturedfrom Æneas. An easy victory, because the goddess Minerva not only breaksthe pole of Eumelus, his most formidable rival, but hands Diomed backhis whip when he drops it: interpreted by our realistic critics to mean,that prudence bids him take a second whip as a reserve. The old“horse-tamer,” Nestor, gives his son Antilochus such cunning directions,that he comes in second, though his horses are confessedly the slowestof the whole field. Next comes the battle with the cœstus--thatbarbarous form of boxing-glove, which, far from deadening the force ofthe blow delivered, made it more damaging and dangerous, inasmuch as thepadding consisted of thongs of raw ox-hide well hardened. The combat inthis case is very unequal, since the giant Epeius speedily fells hisyounger and lighter antagonist, who is carried almost senseless from thelists. The wrestlers are better matched; the skill and subtlety ofUlysses are a counterpoise to the huge bulk and somewhat inactivestrength of Ajax, who lifts his opponent off his feet with ease, but isbrought to the ground himself by a dexterous kick upon the ancle-joint.Another fall, in which neither has the advantage, leads to the dividingof the prize--though how it was to be divided practically is not soclear, since the first prize was a tripod valued at twelve oxen, and thesecond a female captive, reckoned to be worth four.[21] The foot-race iswon by Ulysses, Minerva interfering for the second time to secure thevictory for her favourite, by tripping up the lesser Ajax (son ofOileus), who was leading. The Greek poet does but refer what we shouldcall an unlucky accident to the agency of heaven. A single combat onfoot, with shield and spear, succeeds, the prize for which is the richarmour of which Patroclus had spoiled Sarpedon. He who first draws bloodis to be the winner. Diomed and Ajax Telamon step into the lists, andthe combat between the two great champions grows so fierce and hot, thatthe spectators insist on their being separated, and again the honoursare adjudged to be equal; although Diomed, who was clearly getting theadvantage, receives the chief portion of the divided prize. In thequoit-throwing Ajax is beaten easily; and critics have remarked that inno single contest does the poet allow him, though a favourite with thearmy, to be successful. Those who insist upon the allegorical view ofthe poem, tell us that the lesson is, that brute force is of littleavail without counsel. The archers’ prizes are next contended for, andwe have the original of the story which has been borrowed, with somemodifications, by many imitators from Virgil’s time downwards, andfigures in the history of the English ‘Clym of the Clough,’ and Tell ofSwitzerland. Teucer, reputed the most skilful bowman in the whole host,only shoots near enough to cut the cord which ties the dove to the mast,while Meriones follows the bird with his aim as she soars far into theair, and brings her down, pierced through and through, with his arrow.But Meriones had vowed an offering to Apollo “of the silver bow,” whichTeucer, in the pride of his heart, had neglected. The games are closedwith hurling the spear, when the king Agamemnon himself, desirous to payall honour to his great rival’s grief, steps into the arena as acompetitor. With no less grace and dignity Achilles accepts thecompliment, but forbids the contest. “O son of Atreus, we know thou dostfar surpass us all”--and he hands the prize for his acceptance.The anger against Agamemnon is past: but not so the savage wrath againstHector. Combined with his passionate grief for Patroclus, it amounts tomadness. Morning after morning he rises from the restless couch where hehas lain thinking of his friend, and lashing the dead corpse afresh tohis chariot, drags it furiously thrice round the mound that coversPatroclus’ ashes. Twelve days has the body now lain unburied; but Venusand Apollo preserve it from decay. Venus sheds over it ambrosial roseateunguents, and Apollo covers it with a dark cool cloud. In lessmythological language, the loathliness of death may not mar its beauty,nor the sunbeams breed in it corruption. Even the Olympians are seizedwith horror and pity. In spite of the remonstrances of his stillimplacable queen, Jupiter instructs Thetis to visit her son. and softenhis cruel obduracy. At the same time he sends Iris to Priam, andpersuades him to implore Achilles in person to restore the body of hisson. Accompanied by a single herald, and bearing a rich ransom, the agedking passes the Greek lines by night (for Mercury himself becomes hisguide, disguised in the form of a Greek straggler, and casts a deepsleep upon the sentinels). He reaches the tent of Achilles, who has justended his evening meal, throws himself at his feet, and kisses “thedreadful murderous hands by which so many of his sons have fallen,” inan agony of supplication. He adjures the conqueror, by the thought ofhis own aged father Peleus--now looking and longing for his return--tohave some pity on a bereaved old man, whose son can never return to himalive; and at least to give him back the body.   “And for thy father’s sake look pitying down    On me, more needing pity: since I bear    Such grief as never man on earth hath borne,    Who stoop to kiss the hand that slew my son.”With the impulsive suddenness which is a part of his character, Achillesgives way at once--prepared, indeed, to yield, by his mother’sremonstrances. He gives orders to have the body clothed in costlyraiment, and washed and anointed by the handmaidens; nay, even lifts hisdead enemy with his own hands, and lays him on a couch. Yet he will notlet Priam as yet look upon the corpse, lest at the sight of his griefhis own passion should break out afresh. The father spends the night inthe tent of his son’s slayer, and there he closes his eyes in sleep forthe first time since the day of Hector’s death. In the morning hereturns to Troy with his mournful burden, and the funeral rites ofHector close the poem. The boon which Achilles has granted he makescomplete by the spontaneous offer of twelve days’ truce, that so Troymay bury her dead hero with his rightful honours. The wailings of Priamand Hecuba, though naturally expressed, are but commonplace comparedwith the last tribute of the remorseful Helen:--   “Hector, of all my brethren dearest thou!    True, godlike Paris claims me as his wife,    Who bore me hither--would I then had died!    But twenty years have passed since here I came,    And left my native land; yet ne’er from thee    I heard one scornful, one degrading word;    And when from others I have borne reproach,    Thy brothers, sister, or thy brothers’ wives,    Or mother (for thy sire was ever kind    Even as a father), thou hast checked them still    With tender feeling and with gentle words.    For thee I weep, and for myself no less,    For through the breadth of Troy none love me now,    None kindly look on me, but all abhor.” (D.)CHAPTER XI.CONCLUDING REMARKS.The character of Hector has been very differently estimated. Modernwriters upon Homer generally assume that the ancient bard had, as itwere, a mental picture of all his great heroes before him, of theirinner as well as of their outer man, and worked from this in the variousacts and speeches which he has assigned to each. Probably nothing couldbe further from the truth. If the poet could be questioned as to hisimmortal work, and required to give a detailed character of each of hischief personages, such as his modern admirers present us with, he wouldmost likely confess that such character as his heroes possess was builtup by degrees, as occasion called for them to act and speak, and thathis own portraits (where they were not derived from the currenttraditions) rested but little upon any preconceived ideal. It is verydifficult to estimate character at all in a work of fiction in which theprinciples of conduct are in many respects so different from those ofour own age. How far even the ablest critics have succeeded in theattempt in the case of Hector may be judged from this; that whereasColonel Mure speaks of “a turn for vainglorious boasting” as hischaracteristic defect,[22] Mr Froude remarks that “while Achilles is allpride, Hector is all modesty.”[23] Both criticisms are from writers ofcompetent taste and judgment; but both cannot possibly be true. Therecan be no doubt that Hector makes a considerable number of vauntingspeeches in the course of the poem--vaunts which he does not alwayscarry out; but in this respect he differs rather in degree than inprinciple from most of the other warriors, Greek as well as Trojan; andif the boasts of Achilles are always made good, while Hector’s oftencome to nothing, that follows almost necessarily from the fact thatAchilles is the hero of the tale. A boastful tongue and a mercilessspirit are attributes of the heroic character in Homer: his heroes beara singular resemblance in these two points to the “braves” of theAmerican Indians; while they are utterly unlike them in theirsensitiveness to physical pain, their undisguised horror of death, andtheir proneness to give loud expression to both feelings. Withoutattempting to sketch a full-length portrait, which probably Homerhimself would not recognise, it may be said that Hector interests uschiefly because he is far more human than Achilles, in his weakness aswell as in his strength; his honest love for his wife and child, hispitying condonation of Helen, his half-contemptuous kindness to his weakbrother Paris, his hearty and unselfish devotion to his country.Achilles is the “hero,” indeed, in the classical sense--_i.e._, he isthe demi-god, superior to many of the mortal weaknesses which arepalpable enough in the character of his antagonist: as littlesusceptible to Hector’s alternations of confidence and panic, as to histender anxieties about his wife and child. The contrast between the twois very remarkable; as strong, though of quite a different kind, as thatbetween the two chief female characters in the poem--Helen, charmingeven in her frailty, attracting us and compelling our admiration inspite of our moral judgment; Andromache, the blameless wife and mother,whose charm is the beauty of true womanhood, and whose portrait, asdrawn by the poet, bears strong witness by its sweetness and purity tothe essential soundness of the domestic relations in the age which hedepicts.The poem, as we have seen, ends somewhat abruptly. We learn nothing fromit of the fate of Troy, except so far as we have been taught throughoutthe tale that the fortunes of the city and people depended wholly uponHector. “Achilles’ wrath” was the theme of the song, and now that thishas been appeased, we wait for no further catastrophe. Yet, if Achilleshas been the hero, it is remarkable that the poet’s parting sympathiesappear to rest, as those of the reader almost certainly will, withHector. It would seem that Homer himself felt something of what he makesJupiter express with regard to the Trojans--“They interest me, thoughthey must needs perish.” The Trojan hero must fall, or the glory of theGreek could not be consummated; but the last words of the poem, as theyrecord his funeral honours, so they express the poet’s regretfuleulogy:--    “Such honours paid they to the good knight Hector.”Virgil, in his Æneid, naturally exalts the glory of Hector, because itwas his purpose to trace the origin of the Romans from Troy; but weneed not wonder that in later days, when the Homeric legends were workedup into tales of Christian chivalry, Hector, and not Achilles, becamethe model of a Christian knight. When the great Italian poet drew hischaracter of Orlando, as a type of chivalry, he had the Trojan hero inhis mind.One of the earliest and most curious travesties of the Iliad--for it ishardly more, though made in all good faith, according to the taste ofthe times--was the work of an English troubadour, Benedict de St Maur,of the time of Henry II. It was reproduced, as a prose romance, inLatin, by Guido de Colonna, a Sicilian; but is better known--so far asit can be said to be known at all--as the ‘History of the Warres of theGreeks and Trojans,’ by John Lydgate, monk of Bury St Edmunds, firstprinted in 1513. The writer professedly takes Colonna as his original.The heroes of the Iliad reappear as the knights of modern chivalry; theyfight on horseback, observe all the rules of medieval courtesy, and“fewtre their speres” at each other exactly in the style of theCompanions of the Round Table. Agamemnon is very like Arthur, andAchilles Sir Lancelot, under other names. But Hector is here alsoplainly the favourite hero. Thersites figures as a dwarf, with all themalice and mischief peculiar, and in some degree permitted, to thoseimaginary types of humanity. The closing lines of Lydgate’s third bookwill give some idea of the strange transformation which Homer’s storyundergoes in the hands of our medieval poet, and is a curious instanceof the way in which the zealous churchman “improves” his pagan subject.He is describing the funeral rites of Hector:--   “And when Priam in full thrifty wyse    Performed hath as ye have heard devyse,    Ordained eke, as Guido[24] can you tell,    A certain nombre of priestes for to dwell    In the temple in their devotions,    Continually with devout orisons    For the soule of Hector for to pray.           *       *       *       *       *    To which priestes the kyng gave mansyons,    There to abide, and possessyons,    The which he hath to them mortysed    Perpetually, as ye have heard devysed,    And while they kneel, pray, and wake,    I caste fully me an end to make    Finally of this my thirde booke    On my rude manner as I undertooke.”The way in which the Homeric characters are modernised in Chaucer andDryden, and even in Shakspeare’s ‘Troilus and Cressida,’ is a deviationfrom their originals hardly more excusable, though less absurd, thanthis of Lydgate’s. They copied, in fact, not from the original at all,but from the medieval corruptions of it. Racine’s tragedies are in ahigher vein, and his Iphigenia, though not Homer’s story, does morejustice to some of Homer’s characters: but after all, as has been wellobserved, “they are dressed in the Parisian fashions, with speech andaction accordingly.”[25]The Iliad, as has been already remarked, closes more abruptly than itsmodern title would seem to justify, for the Tale of Troy is left halfuntold. Imitators of the great bard followed him, and though their worksare lost to us, the legends upon which they worked have been reproducedby later writers. The poems once known as the ‘Little Iliad’ and the‘Sacking of Troy’ have left little more than their names, and some fewfragments which, do not raise much regret for the loss of theremainder; but the leading events of which they treated are preserved inthe works of the Greek dramatists and of Virgil. It may not be out ofplace here to sketch briefly the sequel to Homer’s story.Troy fell in that tenth year of the siege, though new and remarkableallies came to the aid of Priam. From the far north of Thrace came aband of Amazons--women-warriors who, in spite of their weaker sex,proved more than a match in battle for the men of Greece. Their queenPenthesilea was said to be the daughter of the War-god; and under herleading, once more the Trojans tried their fortune in the open field,not unsuccessfully, until she too fell by the spear of Achilles.Proceeding to possess himself of her helmet, as the conqueror’s spoil,he was struck with her remarkable beauty, and stood entranced for somemoments in sorrow and admiration. It is the scene from which Tassoborrows his story of Clorinda, and which Spenser had in his mind when hemakes Sir Artegal, after having unhelmed the fair Britomart in combat,let fall his sword at the sight of her “angel-face”--   “His powerless hand, benumbed with secret fear,    From his revengefull purpose shronke abacke,    And cruel sword out of his fingers slacke    Fell down to ground, as if the steel had sence    And felt some ruth, or sence his hand did lacke,    Or both of them did think obedience    To doe to so divine a Beautie’s excellence.”            --B. IV. c. vi. st. 21.Thersites--who had by this time forgotten the chastisement inflicted onhim by Ulysses for his scurrilous tongue--ventured a jest upon Achilles’sensibility, and was struck dead by a blow from the hero’s unarmedhand. Next came upon the scene the tall Ethiopian Memnon, son of theDawn, a warrior of more than mortal beauty, sent either from Egypt orfrom the king of Assyria (for the legends vary), with a contingent offierce negro warriors, who carried slaughter into the Greek ranks, untilMemnon too fell by the hand of the same irresistible antagonist. Thesewere only brief respites for the doomed city. But it was not to fall bythe hand of Achilles. Before its day of destruction came, the Greek herohad met with the fate which he himself foresaw--which had beenprophesied for him alike by his mother the sea-goddess, by the wondrousutterance of his horse Xanthus, and by the dying words of Hector. Anarrow from Paris found the single vulnerable spot in his right heel, andstretched him where he had slain his Trojan enemy--before the Scæangate. But his death, according to the legends, was no more like that ofcommon mortals than his life had been. He does not go down into thosegloomy regions where the ghosts of his friend Patroclus and his enemyHector wander. It was not death, but a translation. The Greeks hadprepared for him a magnificent funeral pile, but the body of the herosuddenly disappeared. His mother Thetis conveyed it away to the islandof Leukè in the Euxine Sea, to enjoy in that seclusion a new andperpetual life. So early is the legend which the romance of Christendomadopted for so many of its favourites--notably for the English Arthur,borne by the three mysterious queens to    “The island valley of Avilion,”where, it was long said and believed, he lay either in a charmed sleepor a passionless immortality. One legend ran that the Greek hero, in hishappy island, was favoured with the society of Helen, whose matchlessbeauty he had much desired to see.His wondrous shield and armour--the masterpieces of Vulcan--were left byThetis as a prize for “the bravest of the Greeks,” and became almost asfatal a source of discord as the golden apple which had been labelledfor “the fairest.” Ulysses and Ajax were the most distinguishedclaimants, and when, as before, counsel was preferred to strength, Ajaxwent mad with vexation, and fell upon his own sword. Ulysses handed onthe coveted armour to its rightful inheritor, the young Neoptolemus, sonof Achilles, who, in accordance with an oracle, had been sent for totake Troy. Still the city held out, secure so long as the sacred imageof Minerva, the “Palladium,” a gift from Jupiter himself, remained inthe citadel: until Ulysses broke the spell by entering within the wallsin disguise, and carrying it off. One quick eye discovered the venturousGreek, through his rags and self-inflicted wounds: Helen recognised him;but she was weary of her guilty life, and became an excusable traitressin favour of her lawful husband. It was again the fertile brain ofUlysses which conceived the stratagem of the wooden horse; and when thecuriosity of the Trojans (against all ordinary probabilities, it must beconfessed) dragged it inside the walls, the armed warriors whom itcontained issued forth in the night, and opened the gates to theircomrades.The details of the sack of the city are neither more nor less horriblethan similar scenes which are unhappily too historical. Priam is slainat the altar of his house; his family either share his fate, or arecarried into captivity. Of the contradictory legends as to the fate of“Hector’s Andromache”--as in Virgil’s great poem she pathetically callsherself--the reader will gladly choose, with that poet, the leastpainful version, which leaves her settled at Buthrotus in Epirus, in apeaceful retirement full of gentle regrets, as the wife of Hector’sbrother Helenus.Of Helen and Menelaus we shall hear more in Homer’s tale of theWanderings of Ulysses. He says nothing of the scene which the laterdramatists give us, by no means inconsistent with his own portrait ofthe pair, when at the taking of the city the outraged husband rushesupon the adulteress with uplifted sword, and drops his weapon at thesight of her well-remembered and matchless beauty. For the miserablesequel of Agamemnon’s story we may refer also to the Odyssey. Few of theGreek heroes returned home in peace. They had insulted the gods of Troy,and they were cursed with toilsome wanderings and long banishment likeUlysses, or met with a worse fate still. Diomed did not indeed leave hiswife Ægiale a heart-broken widow, as Dione in her anger had predicted,but found on his return that she had consoled herself with another loverin his absence, and narrowly escaped assassination by her hand. Teucerwas refused a home by his father, because he did not bring his brotherAjax back with him to the old man. The lesser Ajax was wrecked anddrowned on his homeward voyage. Fate spared Nestor, old as he was, toreturn to his stronghold at Pylos; but his son Antilochus had fallen inthe flower of his age on the plains of Troy. The names of many of thewanderers were preserved in the colonies which they founded along thecoasts of Greece and Italy, and the heroes of the great Siege of Troyspread its fame over all the then known world.

CONCLUDING REMARKS,                                      125It has been thought desirable in these pages to use the Latin names ofthe Homeric deities and heroes, as more familiar to English ears. As,however, most modern translators have followed Homer’s Greeknomenclature, it may be convenient here to give both.        Zeus           =  Jupiter.        Herè           =  Juno.        Arēs           =  Mars.        Poseidōn       =  Neptune.        Pallas Athenè  =  Minerva.        Aphroditè      =  Venus.        Hephaistos     =  Vulcan.        Hermes         =  Mercury.        Artemis        =  Diana.      *       *       *       *       *        Odysseus       =  Ulysses.        Aias           =  Ajax.The passages quoted, unless otherwise specified, are from the admirabletranslation of Mr Worsley.INTRODUCTION.The poem of the Odyssey is treated in these pages as the work of asingle author, and that author the same as the composer of the Iliad. Itwould be manifestly out of place, in a volume which does not profess tobe written for critical scholars, to discuss a question on which theyare so far from being agreed. But it may be satisfactory to assure thereader who has neither leisure nor inclination to enter into thecontroversy, that in accepting, as we do, the Odyssey as from the same“Homer” to whom we owe the Tale of Troy, he may fortify himself by theauthority of many accomplished scholars who have carefully examined thequestion. Though none of the incidents related in the Iliad aredistinctly referred to in the Odyssey--a point strongly urged by thosewho would assign the poems to different authors--and therefore the onecannot fairly be regarded as a sequel to the other, yet there is noimportant discrepancy, either in the facts previously assumed, or in thetreatment of such characters as appear upon the scene in both.The character of the two poems is, indeed, essentially different. TheIliad is a tale of the camp and the battle-field: the Odyssey combinesthe romance of travel with that of domestic life. The key-note of theIliad is glory: that of the Odyssey is rest. This was amongst thereasons which led one of the earliest of Homer’s critics to theconclusion that the Odyssey was the work of his old age. In both poemsthe interest lies in the situations and the descriptions, rather than inwhat we moderns call the “plot.” This latter is not a main considerationwith the poet, and he has no hesitation in disclosing his catastrophebeforehand. The interest, so far as this point is concerned, is alsoweakened for the modern reader by the intervention throughout ofsupernatural agents, who, at the most critical turns of the story, throwtheir irresistible weight into the scale. Yet, in spite of this, theinterest of the Odyssey is intensely human. Greek mythology and Orientalromance are large ingredients in the poem, but its men and women aredrawn by a master’s hand from the actual life; and, since in the twothousand years between our own and Homer’s day nothing has changed solittle as human nature, therefore very much of it is still a story ofto-day.The poem before us is the tale of the wanderings and adventures ofOdysseus--or Ulysses, as the softer tongue of the Latins preferred tocall him--on his way home from the siege of Troy to his island-kingdomof Ithaca. The name Odysseus has been variously interpreted. Homerhimself, who should be the best authority, tells us that it was given tohim by his grandfather Autolycus to signify “the child of hate.” Othershave interpreted it to mean “suffering;” and some ingenious scholars seein it only the ancient form of a familiar sobriquet by which the herowas known, “the little one,” or “the dwarf,”--a conjecture which derivessome support from the fact that the Tyrrhenians knew him under thatdesignation. It may be remembered that in the Iliad he is described asbearing no comparison in stature with the stalwart forms of Agamemnonand Menelaus; and it is implied in the description that there was somewant of proportion in his figure, since he appeared nobler than Menelauswhen both sat down. But in the Odyssey itself there appears no referenceto any natural defect of any kind. His character in this poemcorresponds perfectly with that which is disclosed in the Iliad. There,he is the leading spirit of the Greeks when in council. Scarcely secondto Achilles or Diomed in personal prowess, his advice and opinion arelistened to with as much respect as those of the veteran Nestor. In theIliad, too, he is, as he is called in the present poem, “the man of manydevices.” His accomplishments cover a larger field than those of anyother hero. Achilles only can beat him in speed of foot; he is as goodan archer as Ajax Oileus or Teucer; he throws Ajax the Great in thewrestling-match, in spite of his superior strength, by a happy use ofscience, and divides with him the prize of victory. To him, as theworthiest successor of Achilles--on the testimony of the Trojanprisoners, who declared that he had wrought them most harm of any--thearmour of that great hero was awarded at his death. He is not tragicenough to fill the first place in the Iliad, but we are quite preparedto find him the hero of a story of travel and adventure like theOdyssey, in which the grand figure of Achilles would be entirely out ofplace.The Odyssey has been pronounced, by a high classical authority, to beemphatically a lady’s book. “The Iliad,” says the great Bentley, “Homermade for men, and the Odyssey for the other sex.” This opinion somewhatcontradicts the criticism of an older and greater master--Aristotle--whodefines the Odyssey as being “ethic and complex,” while the Iliad is“pathetic and simple.” Yet it was perhaps some such notion of thefitness of things which made Fénélon’s adaptation of Homer’s story, ‘TheAdventures of Telemachus in search of Ulysses,’ so popular a Frenchtext-book in ladies’ schools a century ago. It is certain, also, thatthe allusions in our modern literature, and the subjects of modernpictures, are drawn from the Odyssey even more frequently than from theIliad, although the former has never been so generally read in ourschools and colleges. Circe and the Sirens, Scylla and Charybdis, havepointed more morals than any incidents in the Siege of Troy. Turner’spictures of Nausicaa and her Maidens, the Gardens of Alcinous, theCyclops addressed by Ulysses, the Song of the Sirens--all amongst ournational heirlooms of art--assume a fair acquaintance with the laterHomeric fable on the part of the public for whom they were painted. Thesecret of this greater popularity may lie in the fact, that while theadventures in the Odyssey have more of the romantic and the imaginative,the heroes are less heroic--have more of the common human type aboutthem--than those of the Iliad. The colossal figure of Achilles in hiswrath does not affect us so nearly as the wandering voyager with hisstrange adventures, his hairbreadth escapes, and his not over-scrupulousdevices.To our English sympathies the Odyssey appeals strongly for anotherreason--it is a tale of voyage and discovery. “It is,” as Dean Alfordsays, “of all poems a poem of the sea.” In the Iliad the poet nevermissed an opportunity of letting us know that--whoever he was andwherever he was born--he knew the sea well, and had a seaman’s tastes.But there his tale confined him chiefly to the plain before Troy, andsuch opportunities presented themselves but rarely. In the Odyssey weroam from sea to sea throughout the narrative, and the restless heroseems never so much at home as when he is on shipboard. It is notwithout reason that the most ancient works of art which bear the figureof Ulysses represent him not as a warrior but as a sailor.The Tale of Troy, as has been already said, embraces in its whole rangethree decades of years. It is with the last ten that the Odyssey has todo; and as in the Iliad, though the siege itself had consumed ten years,it is with the last year only that the poet deals; so in this secondgreat poem also, the main action occupies no more than the last sixweeks of the third and concluding decade.Between the Iliad and the Odyssey there is an interval of events, notrelated in either poem, but which a Greek audience of the poet’s own daywould readily supply for themselves out of a store of current legendquite familiar to their minds, and embodied in more than one ancientpoem now lost to us.[26] Troy, after the long siege, had fallen at last;but not to Achilles. For him the dying prophecy of Hector had been soonfulfilled, and an arrow from the bow of Paris had stretched him indeath, like his noble enemy, “before the Scæan gates.” It was his sonNeoptolemus, “the red-haired,” to whom the oracles pointed as thedestined captor of the city. Ulysses went back to Greece to fetch him,and even handed over to the young hero, on his arrival, the armour ofhis father--his own much-valued prize. In that armour Neoptolemus ledthe Greeks to the storm and sack of the city by night, while the Trojanswere either asleep or holding deep carousal.It has been conjectured by some that, under the name of Ulysses, thepoet has but described, with more or less of that licence to which hehad a double claim as poet and as traveller, his own wanderings andadventures by land and sea. It has been argued, in a treatise of someingenuity,[27] that the poet, whoever he was, was himself a native ofthe island in which he places the home of his hero. There is certainlyone passage which reads very much like the circumstantial and lovingdescription which a poet would give of his sea-girt birthplace, withevery nook of which he would have been familiar from his childhood. Itoccurs in the scene where Ulysses is at last landed on the coast ofIthaca, which he is slow to recognise until his divine guide points outto him the different localities within sight:--      “This is the port of sea-king Phorcys old,      And this the olive at the haven’s brow.      Yonder the deep dark lovely cave behold,      Shrine of the Naïad-nymphs! These shades enfold      The stone-roofed bower, wherein thou oft hast stood,      While to the Nymphs thy frequent vows uprolled,      Steam of choice hecatombs and offerings good.    Neritus hill stands there, high-crowned with waving wood.”[28]As conjecture only all such theories must remain; but it may at least besafely believed that the author had himself visited some of the strangelands which he describes, with whatever amount of fabulous ornament hemay have enriched his tale, and it has a certain interest for the readerto entertain the possibility of a personal narrative thus underlying theromance.THE ODYSSEY.CHAPTER I.PENELOPE AND HER SUITORS.The surviving heroes of the great expedition against Troy, after longwanderings, have at length reached their homes, with oneexception--Ulysses has not been heard of in his island-kingdom ofIthaca. Ten years have nearly passed since the fall of Troy, and stillhis wife Penelope, and his aged father Laertes, and his young sonTelemachus, now growing up to manhood, keep weary watch for the hero’sreturn. There is, moreover, a twofold trouble in the house. It is notonly anxiety for an absent husband, but the perplexity caused by a crowdof importunate suitors for her hand, which vexes the soul of Penelopefrom day to day. The young nobles of Ithaca and its dependent islandshave for many years flocked to the palace to seek the hand of her whomthey consider as virtually a widowed queen. It is to no purpose thatshe professes her own firm belief that Ulysses still survives: she hasno kind of proof of his existence, and the suitors demand of herthat--in accordance with what would appear the custom of thecountry--she shall make choice of some one among them to take the losthero’s place, and enjoy all the rights of sovereignty. How far thelovers were attracted by the wealth and position of the lady, and howfar by the force of her personal charms, is a point somewhat hard todecide. The Roman poet Horace imputes to them the less romantic motive.They were, he says, of that class of prudent wooers--    “Who prized good living more than ladies’ love;”and he even hints that Penelope’s knowledge of their real sentimentshelped to account for her obduracy. But Horace, we must remember, was asatirist by trade. A mere prosaic reader might be tempted to raise thequestion whether the personal charms of Penelope, irresistible as theymight have been when Ulysses first left her for the war, must not havebeen somewhat impaired during the twenty years of his absence; andwhether it was possible for a widow of that date (especially with agrown-up son continually present as a memento) to inspire such veryardent admiration. These arithmetical critics have always been the pestsof poetry. One very painstaking antiquarian--Jacob Bryant--in the courseof his studies on the Iliad, made the discovery, by a comparison ofmythological dates, that Helen herself must have been nearly a hundredyears old at the taking of Troy. But the question of age has beenunanimously voted impertinent by all her modern admirers: she stillshines in our fancy with    “The starlike beauty of immortal eyes”which the Laureate saw in his ‘Dream of Fair Women.’ The heroic legendstake no count of years. Woman is there beautiful by divine right of sex,unless in those few special instances in which, for the purposes of thestory, particular persons are necessarily represented as old anddecrepit. Nor is there any ground for supposing that the suitors ofPenelope, like the courtiers of Queen Elizabeth, persisted inattributing to her fictitious charms. She is evidently not lessbeautiful in the poet’s eyes than in theirs. As beauty has been happilysaid to be, after all, “the lover’s gift,” so also the bestowal of itupon whom he will must be allowed to be the privilege of the poet. Theisland-queen herself says, indeed, that her beauty had fled when Ulyssesleft her, and could only be restored by his return; but this disclaimerfrom the lips of a loving and mourning wife only makes her morecharming, and she is not the only woman, ancient or modern, who hasborrowed an additional fascination from her tears.The suitors of Penelope, strange to say, are living at free quarters inthe palace of the absent Ulysses. Telemachus is too young, apparently,to assert his rights as master of the house on his own or his mother’sbehalf. If the picture be true to the life--and there is no good reasonto suppose it otherwise--we must assume an age of rude licence even inthe midst of considerable civilisation, when, unless a king or chiefcould hold his own by the strong hand, there was small chance of hisrights being respected. A partial explanation may also lie in the factthat the wealth of the king was regarded as in some sort publicproperty, and that to keep open house for all whose rank entitled themto sit at his table was probably a popular branch of the royalprerogative. Telemachus is an only son, and he and his mother haveapparently no near kinsmen to avenge any wrong or insult that may beoffered. There is, besides, somewhat of weakness and tameness in hischaracter, more than befits the son of such a father. He is ahome-nurtured youth, of a gentle and kindly nature, a dutiful andaffectionate son; but his temperament is far too easy for the rude andtroublous times in which his lot is cast, and the roystering crew whoprofess at least to be the wooers of Penelope have not been slow to findit out. Some kindly critics (“Christopher North” among the number) haverefused to see any of these shortcomings in the young prince’scharacter; but his father Ulysses saw them plainly. For thus it is hespeaks, at a later period of the tale, under his disguise of amendicant:--   “Had I but youth as I have heart, or were    The blameless brave Ulysses, or his son,    Then let a stranger strike me headless there,    If against any I leave revenge undone!”But this is anticipating somewhat too much. We must return to theopening of the poem.The fate of Ulysses, so far as any knowledge of it has reached his wifeand son, lies yet in mystery. Only the gods know--and perhaps it were aswell for Penelope not to know--in what unworthy thraldom he is held. Hehas incurred the anger of the great Sea-god, and therefore he is stillforbidden to reach his home. He has lain captive now for seven longyears in Ogygia, the enchanted realm of Calypso--        “Girded of ocean in an island-keep,    An island clothed with trees, the navel of the deep.      “There dwells the child of Atlas, who can sound      All seas, and eke doth hold the pillars tall      Which keep the skies asunder from the ground.      There him, still sorrowing, she doth aye enthral,      Weaving serene enticements to forestal      The memory of his island-realm.”But the goddess of wisdom, who was his protecting genius throughout theperils of the great siege, and by whose aid, as we have seen in theIliad, he has distanced so many formidable competitors in the race forglory, has not forgotten her favourite. The opening scene of the Odysseyshows us the gods in council on Olympus. Neptune alone is absent; he isgone to feast, like Jupiter in the Iliad, with those mysterious people,the far-off Æthiopians--   “Extreme of men, who diverse ways retire,    Some to the setting, some the rising sun.”Minerva takes the opportunity of his absence to remind the Father of thegods of the hard fate of Ulysses, so unworthy of a hero who has deservedso well both of gods and men. It is agreed to send Mercury, themessenger of the Immortals, to the island where Calypso holds Ulyssescaptive in her toils, to announce to him that the day of his returndraws near. Minerva herself, meanwhile, will go to Ithaca, and putstrength into the heart of his son Telemachus, that he may rid his houseof this hateful brood of revellers, and set forth to make search for hisfather. The passage in which the poet describes her visit is a fine one,and it has been finely rendered by Mr Worsley:--     “So ending, underneath her feet she bound      Her faery sandals of ambrosial gold,      Which o’er the waters and the solid ground      Swifter than wind have borne her from of old;      Then on the iron-pointed spear laid hold,      Heavy and tall, wherewith she smites the brood      Of heroes till her anger waxes cold;      Then from Olympus swept in eager mood,    And with the island-people in the court she stood     “Fast by the threshold of the outer gate      Of brave Odysseus: in her hand she bore      The iron-pointed spear, heavy and great,      And, waiting as a guest-friend at the door,      Of Mentes, Taphian chief, the likeness wore;      There found the suitors, who beguiled with play      The hours, and sat the palace-gates before      On hides of oxen which themselves did slay--    Haughty of mien they sat, and girt with proud array.”As the young prince sits thus, an unwilling host in his father’s hall,meditating, says the poet, whether or no some day that father may returnsuddenly and take vengeance on these invaders of his rights, againstwhom he himself seems powerless, he lifts his eyes and sees a strangerstanding at the gate. With simple and high-bred courtesy--the courtesyof the old Bible patriarchs, and even now practised by the Orientals,though the march of modern civilisation has left little remnant of it inour western isles--he hastes to bid the stranger welcome, on the simpleground that he is a stranger, and will hear no word of his errand untilthe rights of hospitality have been paid. Eager as he is to hearpossible news of his father, he restrains his anxiety to question hisguest. Not until the handmaidens have brought water in the silver ewers,and the herald, and the carver, and the dame of the pantry (it is aright royal establishment, if somewhat rude) have each done their officeto supply the stranger’s wants, does Telemachus ask him a singlequestion. But when the suitors have ended their feast, they call formusic and song. They compel Phemius, the household bard, to make mirthfor them. Then, while he plies his voice and lyre for theirentertainment, the son of Ulysses whispers aside with his visitor. Whois he, and whence does he come? Is he a friend of his father’s? For manya guest, and none unwelcome, had come to those halls, as the son wellknows, in _his_ day. Above all, does he bring news of _him_? Then thedisguised goddess tells her story, with a circumstantial minuteness ofinvention which befits wisdom when she condescends to falsehood:--                  “Know, my name is hight      Mentes, the son of brave Anchialus,      And sea-famed Taphos is my regal right;      And with my comrades am I come to-night      Hither, in sailing o’er the wine-dark sea      To men far off, who stranger tongues indite.      For copper am I bound to Temesè,    And in my bark I bring sword-steel along with me.     “Moored is my ship beyond the city walls,      Under the wooded cape, within the bay.      We twain do boast, each in the other’s halls,      Our fathers’ friendship from an ancient day.      Hero Laertes ask, and he will say.”But of Ulysses’ present fate the guest declares he knows nothing; onlyhe has a presentiment that he is detained somewhere in an unwillingcaptivity, but that, “though he be bound with chains of iron,” he willsurely find his way home again. But in any case, as his father’s friend,the supposed Mentes bids Telemachus take heart and courage, and actmanfully for himself. Let him give this train of riotous suitors fairwarning to quit the palace, and waste his substance no more; let hismother Penelope go back to her own father’s house (if she desires to wedagain), and make her choice and hold her wedding-banquet there; and forhis own part, let him at once set sail and make inquiry for his fatherround the coasts of Greece. It may be that Nestor of Pylos, or Menelausof Sparta--the last returned of the chiefs of the expedition--can givehim some tidings. If he can only hear that Ulysses is yet alive, then hemay well endure to wait his return with patience; if assured of hisdeath, it will befit him to take due vengeance on these his enemies. Thedivine visitor even hints a reproach of Telemachus’ presentinactivity:--   “No more, with thews like these, to weakness cling.    Hast thou not heard divine Orestes’ fame,    Who slew the secret slayer of the king    His father, and achieved a noble name?    Thou also, friend, to thine own strength lay claim--    Comely thou art and tall--that men may speak    Thy prowess, and their children speak the same.”The young prince duteously accepts the counsel, as from his father’sfriend, and prays his guest to tarry a while. But Minerva, her missionaccomplished, suddenly changes her shape, spreads wings, and vanishes.Then Telemachus recognises the goddess, and feels a new life andspirit born within him. If we choose to admit an allegoricalinterpretation--more than commonly tempting, as must be confessed, inthis particular case--it is the advent of Wisdom and Discretion to theconscious heart of the youth, hitherto too little awakened to itsresponsibilities.Telemachus returns to his place among the revellers a new man. They arestill listening to the minstrel, Phemius, who chants a lay of the returnof the Greek chiefs from Troy, and the sufferings inflicted on themduring their homeward voyage by the vengeance of the gods. The soundreaches Penelope where she sits apart with her wise maidens, like themother of Sisera, in her “upper chamber”--the “bower” of the ladies ofmediæval chivalry. She comes down the stair, and stands on the thresholdof the banqueting-hall, attracted by the song. But the subject is toopainful. She calls the bard to her, and begs him, for her sake, tochoose some other theme. We must not be too angry with Telemachusbecause, in the first flush of his newly-awakened sense of theresponsibilities of his position, he uses language, in addressing hismother, which to our ears has a sound of harshness and reproach. He bidsher not presume to set limits to the inspiration of the bard--thenoblest theme is ever the best. He reminds her that woman’s kingdom isthe loom and the distaff, and that the rule over men in his father’shouse now belongs to him. Viewed with reference to the tone of the ageas regarded the duties of women,--compared with the parting charge ofHector in the Iliad to the wife he loved so tenderly, and even with ahigher example in Scripture,--there is nothing startling or repulsive insuch language from a son to his mother. To the young prince in his newmood, while the counsels of Minerva were yet ringing in his ears, theabsence and the sufferings of his father might well seem the only themeon which he could endure to hear the minstrel descant; it was of this,he feels, that he needed to be continually reminded. And if hitherto hehas allowed this riotous company to assume that, in the absence ofUlysses, the government of his house has rested in the weak hands of awoman, it shall be so no longer. He will take his father’s place.The mother sees the change in her son’s temper with some surprise--wemay suppose, with somewhat mingled feelings of approval andmortification. The boy has grown into a man on the sudden. The poetgives us but a single word as any clue to the effect upon Penelope ofthis evidently unaccustomed outburst of self-assertion on the part ofTelemachus. “Astonished,” he says, she withdraws at once to her upperchamber, and there weeps her sorrows to sleep. Telemachus himselfaddresses the assembled company in a tone which is evidently as new totheir ears as to those of his mother. He bids them, with a haughtycourtesy, feast their fill to-night; to-morrow he will summon (as is thecustom of the Homeric princes) a council of the heads of the people, andthere he will give them all public warning to quit his father’s house,and feast--if they needs must feast--in each other’s houses, at theirown cost. If they refuse, and still make this riot of an absent man’swealth, he appeals from men to “the gods who live for ever” for a sureand speedy vengeance.The careless revellers mark the change in the young man as instantly asPenelope. For a few moments they bite their lips in silence--“wonderingthat he spake so bold.” The first to answer him is Antinous, the mostprominent ringleader of the confraternity of suitors. His character isvery like that of the worst stamp of the “Cavalier” of the days of ourown Charles II. Brave, bold, and insolent, there is yet a recklessgaiety and a ready wit about him which would have made him at once afavourite in that unprincipled court. He adds to these characteristics aquality of which he might, unhappily, have also found a high examplethere--that of ingratitude. He is bound by strong ties of obligation tothe house of Ulysses; his father had come in former days to seek anasylum with the Chief of Ithaca from the vengeance of the Thesprotians,and had been kindly entertained by him until his death. The son nowanswers Telemachus with a taunting compliment upon the new character inwhich he has just come out. “He means to claim for himself thesovereignty of the island, as his father’s heir, no doubt; but the godsforbid that Ithaca should ever come under the rule of so fierce adespot!” Telemachus makes answer that he will at all events rule hisfather’s house. Upon this, Eurynomus, another leading spirit among therivals--a smoother-tongued and more cautious individual--soothes theangry youth with what seems a plausible recognition of his rights, inorder that he may get an answer to a question on which he feels aninterest not unmixed, as we may easily understand, with some secretapprehension. “Who was this traveller from over sea? and--did he happento bring any news of Ulysses?” But Telemachus has learnt subtlety aswell as wisdom from the disguised goddess. He gives the name assumed byhis visitor, Mentes, an old friend of the house. But as to his father’sreturn, the oracles of the gods and the reports of men all agree inpronouncing it to have now become hopeless. So the revel is renewed tillnightfall; and while the feasters go off to their own quarters somewherenear at hand, Telemachus retires to his chamber (separate, apparently,from the main building), where his old nurse Eurycleia tends him with acareful affection, as though he were still a child, folding and hangingup the vest of fine linen which he takes off when he lies down to sleep,and drawing the bolt of the chamber door through its silver ring whenshe leaves him.The council of notables is summoned for the morrow. No such meeting hasbeen held since the departure of Ulysses for Troy. As Telemachus passesto take his place there, all men remark a new majesty in his looks.      “So when the concourse to the full was grown,      He lifted in his hand the steely spear,      And to the council moved, but not alone,      For as he walked his swift dogs followed near.      Also Minerva did with grace endear      His form, that all the people gazed intent      And wondered, while he passed without a peer.      Straight to his father’s seat his course he bent,    And the old men gave way in reverence as he went.”He makes his passionate protest before them all against the insufferablewaste of his household by this crew of revellers, and against their ownsupineness in offering him no aid to dislodge them. Antinous rises toanswer him, beginning, as before, with an ironical compliment--“theyoung orator’s language is as sublime as his spirit.” But the fault, hebegs to assure him, lies not with the suitors, but with the queenherself. She has been playing fast and loose with her lovers, deludingthem, for these three years past, with vain hopes and false promises.She had, indeed, been practising a kind of pious fraud upon them. Shehad set up a mighty loom, in which she wrought diligently to complete,as she professed, a winding-sheet of delicate texture for her husband’sfather, the aged Laertes, against the day of his death. Not until thissad task was finished, she entreated of them, let her be asked to choosea new bridegroom. To so much forbearance they had all assented; but lo!they had lately discovered that what she wrought by day she carefullyunwound by night, so that the task promised to be an endless one. Someof the handmaidens (who had found their own lovers, too, amongst theirroyal mistress’s many suitors) had betrayed her secret. Antinous isgallant enough to add to this recital of Penelope’s craft warm praisesof the queen herself, even giving her full credit for the bright woman’swit which had so long baffled them all.                            “Matchless skill    To weave the splendid web; sagacious thought,    And shrewdness such as never fame ascribed    To any beauteous Greek of ancient days,    Tyro, Mycene, or Alcmene, loved    Of Jove himself, all whom th’ accomplished queen    Transcends in knowledge--ignorant alone    That, wooed long time, she should at last be won.”--(Cowper.)But they will now be put off no longer--she must make her choice, orthey will never leave the house so long as she remains there unespoused.Telemachus indignantly refuses to send his mother home to her father;and repeats his passionate appeal to the gods for vengeance against thewrongs which he is himself helpless to deal with. At once an omen fromheaven seems to betoken that the appeal is heard and accepted. Twoeagles are seen flying over the heads of the crowd assembled in themarketplace, where they suddenly wheel round, and tear each otherfuriously with beak and talons. The soothsayer is at hand to interpret;the aged Halitherses, who reminds them all how he had foretold, whenUlysses first left his own shores for Troy, the twenty years that wouldelapse before his return. Now, he sees by this portent, the happy dayis near at hand; nay, in his zeal for his master’s house he goes so faras to urge the assembled people to take upon themselves at once thepunishment of these traitors. One of the suitors mocks at the old man’sauguries, and threatens him for his interference. The prophet issilenced; and Telemachus, finding no support from the assembly, asks butfor a ship and crew to be furnished him, that he may set forth in searchof his father. One indignant voice, among the apathetic crowd, is raisedin the young prince’s defence: it is that of Mentor, to whom Ulysses hadintrusted the guardianship of his rights in his absence. His name haspassed into a synonym for all prudent guardians and moral counsellors,chiefly in consequence of Fénélon’s didactic tale of ‘Télémaque,’already mentioned, in which the adventures of the son of Ulysses were“improved,” with elaborate morals, for the benefit of youth; and inwhich Mentor, as the young prince’s travelling tutor, played aconspicuous part. He vents his indignation here in a very strikingprotest against popular ingratitude:--   “Hear me, ye Ithacans;--be never king    From this time forth benevolent, humane,    Or righteous; but let every sceptred hand    Rule merciless, and deal in wrong alone;    Since none of all his people, whom he swayed    With such paternal gentleness and love,    Remembers the divine Ulysses more.”--(Cowper.)He, too, meets with jeers and mockery from the insolent nobles, andTelemachus quits the assembly to wander in melancholy mood along thesea-shore--the usual resort, it will be remarked, of the Homericheroes, when they seek to calm the tumult of grief or anger. Such appealto the soothing influence of what Homer calls the “illimitable” ocean isnot less true to nature than it is characteristic of the poetical andimaginative temperament. Bathing his hands in the sea waves--for prayer,to the Greek as to the Hebrew mind, demanded a preparatorypurification--Telemachus lifts his cry to his guardian goddess, Minerva.At once she stands before him there in the likeness of Mentor. Shespeaks to him words of encouragement and counsel. Evil men may mock athim now; but if he be determined to prove himself the true son of such afather, he shall not lack honour in the end. She will provide him shipand crew for his voyage. Thus encouraged by the divine Wisdom whichspeaks in the person of Mentor, he returns to the banquet-hall, to avoidsuspicion. Yet, when Antinous greets him there with a mocking show offriendship, he wrenches his hand roughly from his grasp, and quits thecompany. Taking into his counsels his nurse Eurycleia--who is the palacehousekeeper also--he bids her make ready good store of provisions forhis voyage: twelve capacious vessels filled with the ripest wine, twentymeasures of fine meal, and grain besides, carefully sewn up in wallets.In the dusk of this very evening, unknown to his mother, he will embark;for the goddess (still in Mentor’s likeness) has chartered for him agalley with twenty stout rowers, which is to lie ready launched for himin the harbour at nightfall. Eurycleia vainly remonstrates with hernursling on his dangerous purpose--      “‘Ah! bide with thine own people here at ease.      There is no call to suffer useless pain,      Wandering always on the barren seas.’      But he: ‘Good nurse, prithee take heart again,      These things are not without a god nor vain.      Swear only that my mother shall not know      Till twelve days pass, or she herself be fain      To ask thee, or some other the tidings show,    Lest her salt tears despoil much loveliness with woe.’”Telemachus’s resolve is fixed. As soon as the shadows of evening fall,Minerva sends a strange drowsiness on the assembled revellers in thehall of Ulysses, so that the wine-cups drop from their hands, and theystagger off early to their couches. Then, in the person of Mentor, shesummons Telemachus to where the galley lies waiting for him, guides himon board, and takes her place beside him in the stern.                                    “Loud and clear      Sang the bluff Zephyr o’er the wine-dark mere      Behind them. By Athene’s hest he blew.      Telemachus his comrades on did cheer      To set the tackling. With good hearts the crew    Heard him, and all things ranged in goodly order true.      “The olive mast, planted with care, they bind      With ropes, the white sails stretch on twisted hide,      And brace the mainsail to the bellying wind.      Loudly the keel rushed through the seething tide.      Soon as the good ship’s gear was all applied,      They ranged forth bowls crowned with dark wine, and poured      To gods who everlastingly abide,      Most to the stern-eyed child of heaven’s great lord.    All night the ship clave onward till the Dawn upsoared.”CHAPTER II.TELEMACHUS GOES IN QUEST OF HIS FATHER.Hitherto, and throughout the first four books of the poem, Telemachus,and not Ulysses, is the hero of the tale. The voyagers soon reach therocky shores of Pylos,[29] the stronghold of the old “horse-tamer,”Nestor. He has survived the long campaign in which so many of hisyounger comrades fell, and is now sitting, surrounded by his sons, at agreat public banquet held in honour of the Sea-god. Telemachus, with anatural modesty not unbecoming his youth, is at first reluctant toaccost and question a chieftain so full of years and renown, and hisattendant guardian has to reassure him by the promise that “heaven willput words into his mouth.” There is no need of question yet, however,either on the side of hosts or guests. Pisistratus, the youngest son ofNestor, upon whom the duties of “guest-master” naturally fall, welcomesthe travellers with the invariable courtesy accorded by the laws ofHomeric society to all strangers as their right, bids them take a seatat the banquet, and proffers the wine-cup--to the supposed Mentorfirst, as the elder. He only requests of them, before they drink, tojoin their hosts in their public supplication to Neptune; for he willnot do them the injustice to suppose prayer can be unknown ordistasteful to them, be they who they may--“All men have need ofprayer.” When the prayer has been duly made by both for a blessing ontheir hosts and for their own safe return, and when they have eaten anddrunk to their hearts’ content, then, and not till then, Nestor inquirestheir errand. The form in which the old chief put his question is asstrongly characteristic of a primitive civilisation as the openhospitality which has preceded it. He asks the voyagers, in so manywords, whether they are pirates?--not for a moment implying that such anoccupation would be to their discredit. The freebooters of the sea inthe Homeric times were dangerous enough, but not disreputable. It was aniron age, when every man’s hand was more or less against his neighbour,and the guest of to-day might be an enemy to-morrow. Nestor’s downrightquestion may help a modern reader to understand the waste of Ulysses’substance in his absence by the lawless spirits of Ithaca. It was onlyso long as “the strong man armed kept his palace” in person that hisgoods were in peace. Telemachus, in reply, declares his name and errand,and implores the old chieftain, in remembrance of the days when he andUlysses fought side by side at Troy, to give him, if he can, sometidings of his father.     “Answered him Nestor, the Gerenian knight:      ‘Friend, thou remind’st me of exceeding pain,      Which we, the Achaians of unconquered might,      There, and in ships along the clouded main,      Led by Achilleus to the spoil, did drain,      With those our fightings round the fortress high      Of Priam king. There all our best were slain--      There the brave Aias and Achilleus lie;    Patroclus there, whose wisdom matched the gods on high.     “‘There too Antilochus my son doth sleep,      Who in his strength was all so void of blame--      Swift runner, and staunch warrior.’”Nestor shows the same love of story-telling which marks his character inthe Iliad. Modern critics who are inclined to accuse the old chief ofgarrulity should remember that, in an age in which there were no dailynewspapers with their “special correspondents,” a good memory and afluent tongue were very desirable qualifications of old age. The oldcampaigner in his retirement was the historian of his own times. Unlesshe told his story often and at length amongst the men of a youngergeneration when they met at the banquet, all memory of the gallant deedsof old would be lost, and even the professional bard would have lackedthe data on which to build his lay. Many a Nestor must have beenready--in season and out of season--to    “Shoulder his crutch, and show how fields were won,”before any Homer could have sung of the Trojan war. Even now, we areready to listen readily to the veteran’s reminiscences of a pastgeneration, whether in war or peace, who has a retentive memory and apleasant style--only he now commonly tells his story in print.Nestor proceeds to tell his guests how the gods, after Troy was taken,had stirred up strife between the brother-kings Agamemnon and Menelaus;and how, in consequence, the fleet had divided, Menelaus with onedivision sailing straight for home, while the rest had waited withAgamemnon in the hope of appeasing the wrath of heaven. Ulysses, who hadat first set sail with Menelaus, had turned back and rejoined hisleader. Of his subsequent fate Nestor knows nothing; but he bids theyoung man take courage. He has heard of the troubles that beset him athome; but if Minerva vouchsafes to the son the love and favour which (aswas known to all the Greeks) she bore to his father, all will go wellwith him yet. Neither Nestor nor Telemachus are aware (though the readeris) that the Wisdom which had made Ulysses a great name was even nowguiding the steps of his son. One thing yet the youth longs to hear fromthe lips of his father’s ancient friend--the terrible story ofAgamemnon’s death by the hands of his wife and her paramour, and thevengeance taken by his son Orestes. It is a tale which he has heard asyet but darkly, but has dwelt upon in his heart ever since the goddess,at her visit under the shape of Mentes, made such significant referenceto the story. Nestor tells it now at length--the bloody legend which,variously shaped, became the theme of the poet and the dramatist fromgeneration to generation of Greek literature. In Homer’s version we misssome of the horrors which later writers wove into the tale; and it isnot unlikely that, in the simpler form in which it is here given, wehave the main facts of an actual domestic tragedy. During Agamemnon’slong absence in the Trojan war, his queen Clytemnestra, sister ofHelen, had been seduced from her marriage faith by her husband’s cousinÆgisthus. In vain had the household bard, faithful to the trustcommitted to him by his lord in his absence, counselled and warned hislady against the peril; and Ægisthus at last, hopeless of his object solong as she had these honest eyes upon her, had caused him to be carriedto a desert island to perish with hunger. So she fell, and Ægisthusruled palace and kingdom. At last Agamemnon returned from the wearysiege, and, landing on the shore of his kingdom, knelt down and kissedthe soil in a transport of joyful tears. It is probably with noconscious imitation, but merely from the correspondence of the poet’smind, that Shakespeare attributes the very same expression of feeling tohis Richard II.:--                        “I weep for joy    To stand upon my kingdom once again.    Dear earth, I do salute thee with my hand,    Though rebels wound thee with their horses’ hoofs:    As a long-parted mother with her child    Plays fondly with her tears, and smiles in meeting,    So weeping, smiling, greet I thee, my earth,    And do thee favour with my royal hands.”Agamemnon meets with as tragical a reception from the usurper of hisrights as did Richard Plantagenet:--     “Many the warm tears from his eyelids shed,      When through the mist of his long-hoped delight      He saw the lovely land before him spread.      Him from high watch-tower marked the watchman wight      Set by Ægisthus to watch day and night,      Two talents of pure gold his promised hire.      Twelve months he watched, lest the Avenger light      Unheeded, and remember his old fire;    Then to his lord made haste to show the tidings dire.     “Forthwith Ægisthus, shaping a dark snare,      Score of his bravest chose, and ambush set,      And bade rich banquets close at hand prepare.      Then he with horses and with chariots met      The king, and welcomed him with fair words, yet      With fraud at heart, and to the feast him led;      There, like a stalled ox, smote him while he fed.”For seven years the adulterer and usurper reigned in security at Mycenæ.But meanwhile the boy Orestes, stolen away from the guilty court by hiselder sister, was growing up to manhood, the destined avenger of blood,at Athens. In the seventh year he came back in disguise to his father’shouse, slew Ægisthus, and recovered his inheritance. There was a darkershadow still thrown over Agamemnon’s death by later poets, which findsno place in Homer. The tragic interest in the dramas of Æschylus andSophocles, which are founded on this story, lies in their representingClytemnestra herself as the murderess of her husband, and Orestes, ashis father’s avenger, not hesitating to become the executioner of hismother as well as of her paramour.Nestor has finished his story, and the travellers offer to return totheir vessel and continue their quest; but the old chieftain will nothear of it. That night, at least, they must remain as his guests--on themorrow he will send them on to the court of Menelaus at Sparta, wherethey may chance to learn the latest tidings of Ulysses. Telemachus’sguardian bids him accept the invitation, then suddenly spreads wings,and takes to flight in the likeness of a sea-eagle; and both Nestor andTelemachus recognise at last that, in the shape of Mentor, the goddessof wisdom has been so long his guide. A sacrifice is forthwith offeredin her honour--a heifer, with horns overlaid with gold; a public banquetis held as before, and then, according to promise, Telemachus is sped onhis journey. A pair of swift and strong-limbed horses--the old chiefknew what a good horse was, and charged his sons specially to take thebest in his stalls--are harnessed for the journey, and good provision ofcorn and wine, “such as was fit for princes,” stored in the chariot.Pisistratus himself mounts beside his new friend as driver. Their firstday’s stage is Pheræ, where they are hospitably entertained by Nestor’sfriend, Diocles; and, after driving all the following day, they reachthe palace gates of Menelaus, in Sparta, when the sun has set upon theyellow harvest fields, “and all the ways are dim.”At Sparta, too, as at Pylos, the city is holding high festival on theevening of their arrival. A double marriage is being celebrated in thehalls of Menelaus. Hermione, his sole child by Helen, is leaving herparents to become the bride of Neoptolemus (otherwise known as Pyrrhus,the “red-haired”), son of the great Achilles; and at the same time theyoung Megapenthes, Menelaus’s son by a slave wife, is to be married inhis father’s house. There is music and dancing in the halls when thetravellers arrive; but Menelaus, like Nestor, will ask no questions ofthe strangers until the bath, and food, and wine in plenty, haverefreshed them, and their horses have good barley-meal and rye setbefore them in the mangers. The magnificence of Menelaus’s palace, asdescribed by the poet, is a very remarkable feature in the tale. Itreads far more like a scene from the ‘Arabian Nights’ than a lay ofearly Greece. The lofty roofs fling back a flashing light as thetravellers enter, “like as the splendour of the sun or moon.” Gold,silver, bronze, ivory, and electrum, combine their brilliancy in thedecorations. The guests wash in lavers of silver, and the water ispoured from golden ewers. Telemachus is struck with wonder at the sight,and can compare it to nothing earthly.   “Such and so glorious to celestial eyne    Haply may gleam the Olympian halls divine!”The palaces of Sparta, as seen in Homer’s vision, contrast remarkablywith the estimate formed of them by the Greek historian of a later age.Thucydides speaks of the city as having no public buildings of anymagnificence, such as would impress a stranger with an idea of its realpower, but wearing rather the appearance of a collection of villages. Itis difficult to conceive that the actual Sparta of a much earlier agecould have contained anything at all corresponding to this Homeric idealof splendour; and the question arises, whether we have here anindistinct record of an earlier and extinct civilisation, or whether thepoet drew an imaginary description from his own recollections of thegorgeous barbaric splendour of some city in the further East, which hehad visited in his travels. If this be nothing more than a poet’sexaggerated and idealised view of an actual state of highercivilisation, which once really existed in the old Greek kingdoms, anddisappeared under the Dorian Heraclids, it is a singular record of abackward step in a nation’s history; and the Homeric poems becomeespecially valuable as preserving the memorials of a state of societywhich would otherwise have passed altogether into oblivion. There isless difficulty in believing the possible existence of anante-historical civilisation which afterwards became extinct, if weremember the splendours of Solomon’s court, as to which the widespreadtraditions of the East only corroborate the records of Scripture, andall which passed away almost entirely with its founder. It is remarkablethat in the ancient Welsh poem, ‘Y Gododin,’ by Aneurin Owen, of whichthe supposed date is A.D. 570, there are very similar properties andscenery: knights in “armour of gold” and “purple plumes,” mounted on“thick-maned chargers,” with “golden spurs,” who must--if ever they rodethe Cambrian mountains--have been a very different race from the wildWelsh who held Edward Longshanks at bay. Are we to look upon this asmerely the common language of all poets? and, if so, how comes it to becommon to all? Were the Welsh who fought in the half-mythical battle ofCattraeth as far superior, in the scale of civilisation, to theirsuccessors who fell at Conway, as the Spartans under Menelaus (ifHomer’s picture of them is to be trusted) were to the Spartans underLeonidas? or was there some remote original, Oriental or other, whencethis ornate military imagery passed into the poetry of such verydifferent nations?So, too, when Helen--now restored to her place in Menelaus’shousehold--comes forth to greet the strangers, her whole surroundingsare rather those of an Eastern sultana than of any princess of Spartanrace.   “Forth from her fragrant chamber Helen passed    Like gold-bowed Dian: and Adraste came    The bearer of her throne’s majestic frame;    Her carpet’s fine-wrought fleece Alcippe bore,    Phylo her basket bright with silver ore,    Gift of the wife of Polybus, who swayed    When Thebes, the Egyptian Thebes, scant wealth displayed.    His wife Alcandra, from her treasured store,    A golden spindle to fair Helen bore,    And a bright silver basket, on whose round    A rim of burnished gold was closely bound.”--(Sotheby.)These elaborate preparations for her “work”--which is some delicatefabric of wool tinged with the costly purple dye--have little in commonwith the household loom of Penelope. Here, as in the Iliad, refinementand elegance of taste are the distinctive characteristics of Helen; andthey help to explain, though they in no way excuse, the fascinationexercised over her by Paris, the accomplished musician and brilliantconverser, rich in all the graces which Venus, for her own evilpurposes, had bestowed on her favourite. Helen is still, as in theIliad, emphatically “the lady;” the lady of rank and fashion, as thingswere in that day, with all the fashionable faults, and all thefashionable good qualities: selfish, and luxurious, gracious andfascinating. Her transgressions, and the seemingly lenient view whichthe poet takes of them, have been discussed sufficiently in the Iliad.They are all now condoned. She has recovered from her miserableinfatuation; and if we are inclined to despise Menelaus for his easytemper as a husband, we must remember the mediæval legends of Arthur andGuinevere, to whom Helen bears, in many points of character, a strongresemblance. The readiness which Arthur shows to have accepted at anytime the repentance of his queen is almost repulsive to modern feeling,but was evidently not so to the taste of the age in which those legendswere popular; nor is it at all clear that such forgiveness is lessconsonant with the purest code of morality than the stern implacabilitytowards such offences which the laws of modern society would enjoin.Menelaus has forgiven Helen, even as Arthur--though not Mr Tennyson’sArthur--would have forgiven Guinevere. But she has not forgiven herself,and this is a strong redeeming point in her character; “shameless” isstill the uncompromising epithet which she applies to herself, as in theIliad, even in the presence of her husband and his guests.They, too, have been wanderers since the fall of Troy, like the lostUlysses. The king tells his own story before he interrogates hisguest:--      “Hardly I came at last, in the eighth year,      Home with my ships from my long wanderings.      Far as to Cyprus in my woe severe,      Phœnice, Egypt, did the waves me bear.      Sidon and Ethiopia I have seen,      Even to Erembus roamed, and Libya, where      The lambs are full-horned from their birth, I ween,    And in the rolling year the fruitful flocks thrice yean.”He has grown rich in his travels, and would be happy, but for thethought of his brother Agamemnon’s miserable end. Another grief, too,lies very close to his heart--the uncertainty which still shrouds thefate of his good comrade Ulysses.      “His was the fate to suffer grievous woe,      And mine to mourn without forgetfulness,      While onward and still on the seasons flow,      And he yet absent, and I comfortless.      Whether he live or die we cannot guess.      Him haply old Laertes doth lament,      And sage Penelope, in sore distress,      And to Telemachus the hours are spent    In sadness, whom he left new-born when first he went.”The son is touched at the reminiscence, and drops a quiet tear, whilefor a moment he covers his eyes with his robe. It is at this juncturethat Helen enters the hall. Her quick thought seizes the truth at once;as she had detected the father through his disguise of rags when he cameas a spy into Troy, so now she recognises the son at once by his strongpersonal resemblance. Then Menelaus, too, sees the likeness, andconnects it with the youth’s late emotion. Young Pisistratus at oncetells him who his friend is, and on what errand they are travellingtogether. Warm is the greeting which the King of Sparta bestows on theson of his old friend. There shall be no more lamentation for thisnight; all painful subjects shall be at least postponed until themorrow. But still, as the feast goes on, the talk is of Ulysses. Helenhas learnt, too, in her wanderings, some of the secrets of Egyptianpharmacy. She has mixed in the wine a potent Eastern drug, which raisesthe soul above all care and sorrow--      “Which so cures heartache and the inward stings,      That men forget all sorrow wherein they pine.      He who hath tasted of the draught divine      Weeps not that day, although his mother die      Or father, or cut off before his eyen      Brother or child beloved fall miserably,    Hewn by the pitiless sword, he sitting silent by.”The “Nepenthes” of Helen has obtained a wide poetical celebrity. Someallegorical interpreters of the poem would have us understand that it isthe charms of conversation which have this miraculous power to make menforget their grief. Without at all questioning their efficacy, it may besafely assumed that the poet had in his mind something more material.The drug has been supposed to be opium; but the effects ascribed to theArabian “haschich”--a preparation of hemp--correspond very closely withthose said to be produced by Helen’s potion. Sir Henry Halford thoughtit might more probably be the “hyoscyamus,” which he says is still usedat Constantinople and in the Morea under the name of “_Nebensch_.”[30]Not till the next morning does Telemachus discuss with Menelaus theobject of his journey. What little the Spartan king can tell him of thefate of his father is so far reassuring, that there is good hope he isyet alive. But he is--or was--detained in an enchanted island. There thegoddess Calypso holds him an unwilling captive, and forces her love uponhim. He longs sore for his home in Ithaca; but the spells of theenchantress are too strong. So much has Menelaus learnt, during his ownwanderings, while wind-bound at Pharos in Egypt, from Proteus, “the oldman of the sea”--    “Who knows all secret things in ocean pent.”The knowledge had to be forced from him by stratagem. Proteus was in thehabit of coming up out of the sea at mid-day to sleep under the shadowof the rocks, with his flock of seals about him. Instructed by hisdaughter Eidothea--who had taken pity on the wanderers--Menelaus andsome of his comrades had disguised themselves in seal-skins[31] (thoughmuch disturbed, as he confesses, by the “very ancient and fish-likesmell”), and had seized the ancient sea-god as he lay asleep on theshore. Proteus, like the genie in the Arabian tale, changed himselfrapidly into all manner of terrible forms; but Menelaus held him fastuntil he was obliged to resume his own, when, confessing himselfvanquished by the mortal, the god proceeded in recompense to answer hisquestions as to his own fate, and that of his companion chiefs, thewanderers on their way home from Troy. The transformations of Proteushave much exercised the ingenuity of the allegorists. The pliancy ofsuch principles of interpretation becomes amusingly evident, when oneauthority explains to us that here are symbolised the wiles ofsophistry--another, that it is the inscrutability of truth, everescaping from the seeker’s grasp; while others, again, see in Proteusthe versatility of nature, the various ideals of philosophers, or thechanges of the atmosphere. From such source had the king learnt theterrible end of his brother Agamemnon, and the ignoble captivity ofUlysses; but for himself, the favourite of heaven, a special exemptionhas been decreed from the common lot of mortality. It is thus thatProteus reads the fates for the husband of Helen:--   “Thee to Elysian fields, earth’s farthest end,    Where Rhadamanthus dwells, the gods shall send;    Where mortals easiest pass the careless hour;    No lingering winters there, nor snow, nor shower,    But ocean ever, to refresh mankind,    Breathes the shrill spirit of the western wind.”The grand lines of Homer are thus grandly rendered by Abraham Moore.Homer repeats the description of the Elysian fields, the abode of theblest, in a subsequent passage of the poem, which has been translatedalmost word for word--yet as only a poet could translate it--by theRoman Lucretius. Mr Tennyson has the same great original before him whenhe makes his King Arthur see, in his dying thought,        “The island-valley of Avilion,    Where falls not hail nor rain nor any snow,    Nor ever wind blows loudly; but it lies    Deep-meadowed, happy, fair with orchard lawns,    And bowery hollows crowned with summer sea.”The calm sweet music of these lines has charmed many a reader who neverknew that the strain had held all Greece enchanted two thousand yearsago. It has been scarcely possible to add anything to the quiet beautyof the original Greek, but the English poet has at least shown exquisiteskill in the setting of the jewel. But Homer has always been held ascommon property by later poets. Milton’s classical taste had previouslyadopted some of the imagery; the “Spirit” in the ‘Masque of Comus’speaks of the happy climes which are his proper abode:--   “There eternal summer dwells,    And west winds, with musky wing,    About the cedarn alleys fling    Nard and cassia’s balmy smells.”Gladly would Menelaus have kept the son of his old comrade with himlonger as a guest, but Telemachus is impatient to rejoin his galley,which waits for him at Pylos. His host reluctantly dismisses him, notwithout parting gifts; but the gift which the king would have had himtake--a chariot and yoke of three swift horses--the island-prince willnot accept. Ithaca has no room for horse-coursing, and he loves hisrocky home all the better.   “With me no steeds to Ithaca shall sail.    Such leave I here--thy grace, thy rightful vaunt,    Lord of a level land, where never fail    Lotus, and rye, and wheat, and galingale:    No room hath Ithaca to course, no mead--    Goat-haunted, dearer than horse-feeding vale.”There is much consternation in the palace of Ulysses when the absence ofTelemachus is at last discovered. Antinous and his fellow-revellers arestruck with astonishment at the bold step he has suddenly taken, andwith alarm at the possible result. Antinous will man a vessel at once,and waylay him in the straits on his return. The revelation of this plotto Penelope by Medon, the herald, one of the few faithful retainers ofUlysses’ house, makes her for the first time aware of her son’sdeparture; for old Eurycleia has kept her darling’s secret safe evenfrom his mother. Justin asked Gato, "How are you?". In an agony of grief she sits down amidst hersympathising maidens, and bewails herself as “twice bereaved,” of sonand husband. She lifts her prayer to Minerva, and the goddess hears.When Penelope has wept herself to sleep, there stands at the head of hercouch what seems the form of her sister Iphthimè, and assures her of herson’s safety: he has a guardian about his path “such as many a herowould pray to have.” Even in her dream, Penelope is half conscious ofthe dignity of her visitor; and, true wife that she is, she prays thevision to tell her something of her absent husband. But such revelation,the figure tells her, is no part of its mission, and so vanishes intothin air. The sleeper awakes--it is a dream indeed; but it has left alightness and elasticity of spirit which the queen accepts as an auguryof good to come.CHAPTER III.ULYSSES WITH CALYPSO AND THE PHÆACIANS.The fifth book of the poem opens with a second council of the gods. Ithas been remarked with some truth that the gods of the Odyssey are, onthe whole, more dignified than those of the Iliad. They are divided inthis poem, as well as in the other, in their loves and hates towardsmortals, but their dissensions are neither so passionate nor sogrotesque. Minerva complains bitterly to the Ruler of Olympus of theinjustice with which her favourite Ulysses is treated, by being kept solong an exile from his home. She, too, repeats the indignant protestwhich the poet had before put into the mouth of Mentor, which has foundvent in all times and ages, from Job and the Psalmist downwards, when inthe bitterness of a wounded spirit men rebel against what seems theinequality of the justice of heaven; that “there is one event to therighteous and the wicked;” nay, that the wicked have even the best ofit. “Let never king henceforth do justly and love mercy; but let himrule with iron hand and work all iniquity; for lo! what is Ulysses’reward?” Jupiter is moved by the appeal. He at once despatches Mercuryto the island of Calypso, to announce to her that Ulysses must bereleased from her toils; such is his sovereign will, and it must beobeyed. The description of the island-grotto in which Calypso dwells isone of the most beautiful in Homer, and it is a passage upon which ourEnglish translators have delighted to employ their very best powers.Perhaps Leigh Hunt’s version is the most simply beautiful, and asfaithful as any. Mercury has sped on his errand;--   “And now arriving at the isle, he springs    Oblique, and landing with subsided wings,    Walks to the cavern ’mid the tall green rocks,    Where dwelt the goddess with the lovely locks.    He paused; and there came on him, as he stood,    A smell of cedar and of citron wood,    That threw a perfume all about the isle;    And she within sat spinning all the while,    And sang a low sweet song that made him hark and smile.    A sylvan nook it was, grown round with trees,    Poplars, and elms, and odorous cypresses,    In which all birds of ample wing, the owl    And hawk, had nests, and broad-tongued waterfowl.    The cave in front was spread with a green vine,    Whose dark round bunches almost burst with wine;    And from four springs, running a sprightly race,    Four fountains clear and crisp refreshed the place;    While all about a meadowy ground was seen,    Of violets mingling with the parsley green.”Calypso recognises the messenger, for the immortals, says the poet, knoweach other always. Mercury tells his errand--a bitter one for the nymphto hear, for she has set her heart upon her mortal lover. Very hard andenvious, she says, is the Olympian tyrant, to grudge her this harmlessfancy. [She must have thought in her heart, though the poet does notput it into words for her, that Jupiter should surely have somesympathy for weaknesses of which he set so remarkable an example.] Butshe will obey, as needs she must. Ulysses shall go; only he must buildhimself a boat, for there is none in her island. She goes herself toannounce to him his coming deliverance. She finds him sitting pensively,as is his wont, on the sea-beach, looking and longing in the directionof Ithaca.   “Companion of the rocks, the livelong light,    He dreaming on the shore, but not at rest,    With groans and tears and lingering undelight    Gazed on the pulses of the ocean’s breast.”His heart is in his native island; but, sooth to say, he makes the bestof his present captivity. He endures, if he does not heartilyreciprocate, the love of his fair jailer. The correspondence in manypoints of these Homeric lays with the legends of mediæval Christendom,especially with those of Arthur and his Round Table, has been alreadynoticed. It has been said also that, on the whole, the moral tone ofHomer is far purer. But there is one bright creation of mediæval fictionwhich finds no counterpart in the song of the Greek bard. It was onlyChristianity--one might almost say it was only mediævalChristianity--which could conceive the pure ideal of the stainlessknight who has kept his maiden innocence,--who only can sit in the“siege perilous” and win the holy Grail, “because his heart is pure.”Among all the heroes of Iliad or Odyssey there is no Sir Galahad.Calypso obeys the behest of Jove reluctantly, but without murmuring.Goddess-like or woman-like, however, she cannot fail to be mortified atthe want of any reluctance on her lover’s part to leave her. There issomething touching in her expostulation:--      “Child of Laertes, wouldst thou fain depart      Hence to thine own dear fatherland? Farewell!      Yet, couldst thou read the sorrow and the smart,      With me in immortality to dwell      Thou wouldst rejoice, and love my mansion well.      Deeply and long thou yearnest for thy wife;      Yet her in beauty I perchance excel.      Beseems not one who hath but mortal life    With forms of deathless mould to challenge a vain strife.”Ulysses’ reply is honest and manful:--      “All this I know and do myself avow.      Well may Penelope in form and brow      And stature seem inferior far to thee,      For she is mortal, and immortal thou.      Yet even thus ’tis very dear to me    My long-desired return and ancient home to see.      “But if some god amid the wine-dark flood      With doom pursue me, and my vessel mar,      Then will I bear it as a brave man should.      Not the first time I suffer. Wave and war      Deep in my life have graven many a scar.”It cannot but be observed, however, that while Penelope’s whole thoughtsand interests are concentrated upon her absent husband, the longing ofUlysses is rather after his fatherland than his wife. She is only one ofthe many component parts of the home-scene which is ever before thewanderer’s eyes; and not always the most important part, for his agedfather and mother and his young son seem to be at least equal objectsof anxiety. It may be urged that in this parting scene with Calypso heis purposely reticent in the matter of his affection for Penelope, notcaring to draw down upon himself the proverbial wrath of “a womanscorned;” and that for a similar reason he suppresses his feelings, andquite ignores the existence of his wife, at the court of Alcinous, whenthat king offers him his daughter in marriage. But there is, to say theleast, some lack of enthusiasm on the husband’s part throughout. Of thesingle-hearted devotion of woman to man we have striking instances bothin Penelope and in the Andromache of the Iliad; but the devotion of manto woman had yet long to wait for its development in the age ofchivalry.He builds himself a boat on the island, by Calypso’s instructions, andwhen all is ready, she stores it plentifully with food and wine, andgives him directions for his voyage. He launches and sets sail; but theangry god of the sea (irate especially against Ulysses for havingblinded his son, the giant Polyphemus, as we shall learn hereafter)stirs winds and waves against him, wrecks his bark, and leaves himclinging for life to a broken spar. One of the sea-nymphs, Ino, takespity on him, and gives him a charmed scarf--so long as he wears it hislife is safe. For two nights and days he is tossed helplessly on theocean; on the third, with sore wounds and bruises, he makes good hislanding on the rock-bound coast of a strange island. Utterly exhausted,he scrapes together a bed of leaves, and creeping into it, sinks into aprofound sleep.He awakes to find himself in a kind of faeryland. The island on whichhe has been cast is Scheria,[32] inhabited by the Phæacians, whose kingand people are very far indeed from being of the ordinary type of mortalmen. Whether the poet, in his description of these Phæacian islanders,was exercising his imagination only, or indulging his talent for satire,is a controverted question with Homeric critics. Those who would assignthis poem of the Odyssey to a different author from the writer orwriters of the Iliad, and to a much later date than that commonly givento Homer, have thought that in the good-humoured boastfulness of thePhæacian character, their love of pleasure and novelty, and theirattachment to the sea, some Ionian poet was showing up, under fictitiousnames, the weaknesses of his own countrymen. Others take the Phæaciansto be only another name for the Phœnicians, the sailors of all seas, whohad probably in their character somewhat of the egotism and exaggerationwhich have been commonly reputed faults of men who have travelled farand seen much. Whatever may be the true interpretation of the story, orwhether there be any interpretation at all, this curious episode in theadventures of Ulysses is unquestionably rather comic than serious. Thenames are all significant, somewhat after the fashion of those assumedby the Red men. The king (Alcinous) is “Strong-mind,” son of “The SwiftSeaman,” and he has a brother called “Crusher of Men.” The nauticalnames of his courtiers--“Prow-man” and “Stern-man,” and the rest--are aspalpably conventional as our own Tom Bowline and Captain Crosstree. Thehero’s introduction to his new hosts presents, nevertheless, one of themost beautiful scenes in the poem. The patriarchal simplicity of thetale cannot fail to remind the reader, as Homer so often does, of thenarratives of the earlier Scriptures.The princess Nausicaa, daughter of the king of the Phæacians, has had adream. The dream--which comes as naturally to princesses, no doubt, asto other young people--is of marriage; and in this case it could be nopossible reproach to the dreamer, since the goddess of wisdom isrepresented as having herself suggested it. Nor is the dream of anybridegroom in particular, but simply of what seems to us the veryprosaic fact that a wedding outfit, which must soon come to be thoughtof, required household stores of good linen; and that the family stockin the palace, from long disuse, stood much in need of washing. Nausicaaawakes in the morning, and begs of her father to lend her a chariot anda yoke of mules, that she and her maidens may go down to the shore,where the river joins the sea, to perform this domestic duty. Thepastoral simplicity of the whole scene is charming. It has all thefreshness of those earlier ages when the business of life was soleisurely and jovially conducted, that much of it wore the features of aholiday. The princess and her maidens plunge the linen in the stream,and stamp it clean with their pretty bare feet (a process which willremind an English reader of Arlette and Robert of Normandy, and whichmay be seen in operation still at many a burn-side in Scotland), andthen go themselves to bathe. An outdoor banquet forms part of the day’senjoyment; for the good queen, Nausicaa’s mother, has stored the wainwith delicate viands and a goat-skin of sweet wine. When this is over,the girls begin to play at ball. Ulysses, be it remembered, is all thiswhile lying fast asleep under his heap of leaves, and, as it happens,close by the spot where this merry party are disporting themselves. Bychance Nausicaa, too eager in her game, throws the ball out into thesea; whereupon the whole chorus of handmaidens raise a cry of dismay,which at once awakens the sleeper. He is puzzled, when he comes tohimself, to make out where he is; and still more confounded, when hepeers out from his hiding-place, to find himself in the closeneighbourhood of this bevy of joyous damsels, especially when hebethinks himself of the very primitive style of his present costume; forthe scarf which the sea-nymph gave him us a talisman he had cast intothe sea upon his landing, as she had especially charged him. But Ulyssesis far too old a traveller to allow an over-punctilious modesty to standin his way when he is in danger of starving. He has no idea of missingthis opportunity of supplying his wants merely because he has lost hiswardrobe. He extemporises some very slight covering out of anolive-bough, and, in this strange attire, makes his sudden appearancebefore the party. Nausicaa’s maidens all scream and take to flight--veryexcusably; but the king’s daughter, with a true nobility, stands firm.She sees only a shipwrecked man, and “to the pure all things are pure.”Ulysses is a courtier as well as a traveller, and knows much of “citiesand men;” and it is not the flattery of a suppliant, but the quickdiscernment of a man of the world, which makes him at once assign hertrue rank to the fair stranger who stands before him. He remains at arespectful distance, while, in the language of Eastern compliment, hecompares her to the young palm-tree for grace and beauty, and invokesthe blessing of the gods upon her marriage-hour, if she will take pityon his miserable case. Nausicaa recalls her fugitive attendants, andrebukes them for their folly, reminding them that “the stranger and thepoor are the messengers of the gods.” The shipwrecked hero is suppliedat once with food and drink and raiment; and when he reappears, afterhaving bathed and clothed himself, it is with a mien and stature moremajestic than his wont, with the “hyacinthine locks” of immortal youthflowing round his stately shoulders--such grace does his guardiangoddess bestow upon him, that he may find favour in the sight of thePhæacian princess. She looks upon him now with simple and undisguisedadmiration, confessing aside to her handmaidens that, when her time formarriage _does_ come, she should wish for just such a husband as thisgodlike stranger. There is nothing unmaidenly in such language from thelips of Nausicaa. To remain unmarried was a reproach in her day,whatever it may be in ours, and a reproach not likely to fall upon aking’s daughter; so, looking upon the marriage state as inevitable, andat her age very near at hand, she thinks and speaks of it unreservedlyto her companions. Our modern conventional silence on such topics arisesin great degree from the fact that a perpetual maidenhood is theinevitable lot of far too many in our over-civilised society, and, beinginevitable, is no reproach. It does not consort, therefore, withmaidenly dignity to express any interest about marriage, for which anopportunity may never be offered.But Nausicaa is at least as careful to observe the proprieties,according to her own view of them, as any modern young lady. She willpromise the shipwrecked stranger a welcome at her father’s court; but hemust by no means ride home in the wain with her, or even be seenentering the city in her company. So Ulysses runs by the side of hermules, and waits in a sacred grove near the city gates, until theprincess and her party have re-entered the palace. When they havedisappeared, he issues forth, and meets a girl carrying a pitcher. It isonce more his guardian goddess in disguise. She veils him in a mist, sothat he passes the streets unquestioned by the natives (who have no lovefor strangers), and stands at last in the presence of King Alcinous.The king of the Phæacians, as well as his queen, boast to be descendedfrom Neptune. His subjects therefore, are, as has been said,emphatically a seagoing people. Ulysses has already seen withadmiration, as he passed,   “The smooth wide havens, and the glorious fleet,     Wherewith those mariners the great deep tire.”Their galleys, moreover, are unlike any barks that ever walked the seasexcept in a poet’s imagination. King Alcinous himself describes them:--     “For unto us no pilots appertain,      Rudder nor helm which other barks obey.      These, ruled by reason, their own course essay      Sharing men’s mind. Cities and climes they know,      And through the deep sea-gorges cleaving way,      Wrapt in an ambient vapour, to and fro    Sail in a fearless scorn of scathe or overthrow.”The wondrous art of navigation might well seem nothing less thanmiraculous in an age when all the forces of nature were personified asgods. So, when the great ship Argo carried out her crew of ancientheroes on what was the first voyage of discovery, the fable ran that inher prow was set a beam cut from the oak of Dodona, which had the giftof speech, and gave the voyagers oracles in their distress. Our EnglishSpenser must have had these Phæacian ships in mind when he describes the“gondelay” which bears the enchantress Phædria:--     “Eftsoone her shallow ship away did slide,      More swift than swallow sheres the liquid sky,      Withouten oar or pilot it to guide,      Or winged canvass with the wind to fly;      Only she turned a pin, and by-and-by      It cut a way upon the yielding wave,      (Ne cared she her course for to apply)      For it was taught the way which she would have,    And both from rocks and flats itself could wisely save.”As the men of Phæacia excel all others in seamanship, so also do thewomen in the feminine accomplishments of weaving and embroidery. Butthey are not, as they freely confess, a nation of warriors: they lovethe feast and the dance and the song, and care little for what other mencall glory. The palace of Alcinous and its environs are all inaccordance with this luxurious type of character. All round the palacelie gardens and orchards, which rejoice in an enchanted climate, underwhose influence their luscious products ripen in an unfailingsuccession:--     “There in full prime the orchard-trees grow tall,      Sweet fig, pomegranate, apple fruited fair,      Pear and the healthful olive. Each and all      Both summer droughts and chills of winter spare;      All the year round they flourish. Some the air      Of Zephyr warms to life, some doth mature.      Apple grows old on apple, pear on pear,      Fig follows fig, vintage doth vintage lure;    Thus the rich revolution doth for aye endure.”When the traveller enters within the palace itself, he finds himselfsurrounded with equal wonders.     “For, like the sun’s fire or the moon’s, a light      Far streaming through the high-roofed house did pass      From the long basement to the topmost height.      There on each side ran walls of flaming brass,      Zoned on the summit with a blue bright mass      Of cornice; and the doors were framed of gold;      Where, underneath, the brazen floor doth glass      Silver pilasters, which with grace uphold    Lintel of silver framed; the ring was burnished gold.     “And dogs on each side of the doors there stand,      Silver and gold, the which in ancient day      Hephæstus wrought with cunning brain and hand,      And set for sentinels to hold the way.      Death cannot tame them, nor the years decay.      And from the shining threshold thrones were set,      Skirting the walls in lustrous long array,      On to the far room, where the women met,    With many a rich robe strewn and woven coverlet.     “There the Phæacian chieftains eat and drink,      While golden youths on pedestals upbear      Each in his outstretched hand a lighted link,      Which nightly on the royal feast doth flare.      And in the house are fifty handmaids fair;      Some in the mill the yellow corn grind small;      Some ply the looms, and shuttles twirl, which there      Flash like the quivering leaves of aspen tall;    And from the close-spun weft the trickling oil will fall.”King Alcinous sits on his golden throne, “quaffing his wine like a god.”His queen, Arete, sits beside him, weaving yarn of the royal purple.Warned by his kind friend the princess, Ulysses passes by the king’sseat, and falls at the feet of the queen. In the court ofPhæacia--whether the story be disguised fact or pure fiction, whetherthe poet was satiric or serious--the ruling influence lies with thewomen. The mist in which Minerva had enveloped his person melts away;and while all gaze in astonishment at his sudden appearance, he claimshospitality as a shipwrecked wanderer, and then, after the fashion ofsuppliants, seats himself on the hearth-stone. The hospitality ofAlcinous is prompt and magnificent. He bids one of his sons rise up andcede the place of honour to the stranger. If he be mortal man, the boonhe asks shall be granted; but it may be that he is one of the immortals,who, as he gravely assures his guest, often condescend to come down andshare the banquets of the Phæacians, and make themselves known to themface to face. Ulysses assures his royal host, in a passage which is initself sufficient to mark the subdued comedy of the episode, that farfrom having any claim to divinity, he is very mortal indeed, and whollytaken up at present with one of the most inglorious of mortalcravings:--     “Nothing more shameless is than Appetite,      Who still, whatever anguish load our breast,      Makes us remember, in our own despite,      Both food and drink. Thus I, thrice wretched wight,      Carry of inward grief surpassing store,      Yet she constrains me with superior might,      Wipes clean away the memory-written score,    And takes whate’er I give, and taking, craveth more.”[33]There is every appliance to satisfy appetite, however, in the luxurioushalls of Alcinous. While Ulysses is seated at table, Queen Arete,careful housewife as she is with all her royalty, marks with somecuriosity that the raiment which their strange guest wears must havecome from her own household stores--so well does she know the work ofherself and her handmaidens. This leads to a confession on Ulysses’ partof his previous interview with Nausicaa, whom he praises, as he had goodright to do, as wise beyond her years. So charmed is the king with hisguest’s taste and discernment, that he at once declares that nothingwould please him better than to retain him at his court in thecharacter of a son-in-law. Ulysses (whose fate it is throughout hiswanderings to make himself only too interesting to the fair sexgenerally) is by this time too much accustomed to such proposals to showany embarrassment. With his usual diplomacy he puts the questionaside--bowing his acknowledgments only, it may be, though Homer does nottell us even so much as this. The one point to which he addresseshimself is the king’s promise to send him safe home, which he acceptswith thankfulness. Before they retire for the night, the queen herselfdoes not disdain to give special orders for their guest’s accommodation.She bids her maidens prepare      “A couch beneath the echoing corridor,      And thereon spread the crimson carpets fair,      Then the wide coverlets of richness rare,      And to arrange the blankets warm and white,      Wherein who sleepeth straight forgets his care.      They then, each holding in her hand a light,    From the great hall pass forth, and spread the robes aright.”The combination of magnificence with simplicity is of a wholly Orientalcharacter. The appliances of the court might be those of a modernEastern potentate; yet the queen is a thrifty housekeeper, theprincess-royal superintends the family wash, and the five sons of theroyal family, when their sister comes home, themselves come forward andunyoke her mules from the wain which has brought home the linen.The next day is devoted to feasting and games in honour of the stranger.Amongst the company sits the blind minstrel Demodocus, in whose personit has been thought that the poet describes himself--      “Whom the Muse loved, and gave him good and ill;      Ill, that of light she did his eyes deprive,      Good, that sweet minstrelsies divine at will      She lent him, and a voice men’s ears to thrill.      For him Pontonous silver-studded chair      Set with the feasters, leaning it with skill      Against the column, and with tender care    Made the blind fingers feel the harp suspended there.”Such honour has the bard in all lands. The king’s son does not disdainto guide “the blind fingers;” and when the song is over, the heraldleads him carefully to his place at the banquet, where his portion is ofthe choicest--“the chine of the white-tusked boar.” The subject of hislay is the tale which charms all hearers--Phæacian, Greek, or Roman,ancient or modern, then as now--the tale of Troy. Touched with theremembrances which the song awakens, Ulysses wraps his face in hismantle to hide his rising tears. The king marks his guest’s emotion: toocourteous to allude to it, he contents himself with rising at once fromthe banquet-table, and giving order for the sports to begin. Foot-race,wrestling, quoit-throwing, and boxing, all have their turn; and in allthe king’s’ sons take their part, not unsuccessfully. It is suggested atlast that the stranger, who stands silently looking on, should exhibitsome feat of strength or skill. Ulysses declines--he has no heart justnow for pastimes. Then one of the young Phæacians, Euryalus, who hasjust won the wrestling-match, gives vent to an ungracious taunt. Theirguest, he says, is plainly no hero, nor versed in the noble science ofathletics; he must be some skipper of a merchantman, “whose talk is allof cargoes.” He brings down upon himself a grand rebuke from Ulysses:--      “Man, thou hast not said well; a fool thou art.      Not all fair gifts to all doth God divide,      Eloquence, beauty, and a noble heart.      One seems in mien poor, but his feebler part      God crowns with language, that men learn to love      The form, so feelingly the sweet words dart      Within them. First in councils he doth prove,    And, ’mid the crowd observant, like a god doth move.      “Another, though in mould of form and face      Like the immortal gods he seems to be,      Hath no wise word to crown the outward grace      So is thine aspect fair exceedingly,      Wherein no blemish even a god might see;      Yet is thine understanding wholly vain.”Then the hero who has thrown the mighty Ajax in the wrestling-ring, whois swifter of foot than any Greek except Achilles, and who has beenawarded that matchless hero’s arms as the prize of valour against allcompetitors,--rises in his wrath, and gives his gay entertainers a tasteof his quality. Not deigning even to throw off his mantle, he seizes ahuge stone quoit, and hurls it, after a single swing, far beyond thepoint reached by any of the late competitors. The astonished islanderscrouch to the ground as it sings through the air above their heads. Onceroused, Ulysses launches out into the self-assertion which has beenremarked as being common to all the heroes of Homeric story. Hechallenges the whole circle of bystanders to engage with him inwhatsoever contest they will--    “All feats I know that are beneath the sun.”He will not, indeed, compare himself with some of the heroes of old,such as were Hercules and Eurytus;   “But of all else I swear that I stand first,    Such men as now upon the earth eat bread.”None of the Phæacians will accept the challenge. The king commends thespirit in which the stranger has repelled the insult of Euryalus, andwith the gay good-humour which marks the Phæacian character, confessesthat in feats of strength his nation can claim no real excellence, butonly in speed of foot and in seamanship; or, above all, in the dance--inthis no men can surpass them. His guest shall see and judge. Nine graveelders, by the king’s command (and here the satire is evident, even ifwe have lost the application) stand forth as masters of the ceremonies,and clear the lists for dancing. A band of selected youths perform anelaborate ballet, while the minstrel Demodocus sings to his harp asportive lay, not over-delicate, of the stolen loves of Mars and Venus,and their capture in the cunning net of Vulcan. If it must be grantedthat this song forms a strong exception to the purity of Homer’s muse,it has also been fairly pleaded for him, that it is introduced ascharacteristic of an unwarlike nation and an effeminate society. Buteven in his lightest mood the poet has no sort of sympathy with awife’s unfaithfulness. He takes his gods and goddesses as he found themin the popular creed; bad enough, and far worse than the mortal men andwomen of his own poetical creation. But his own morals are far higherthan those of Olympus. Even in this questionable ballad of the Phæacianminstrel the point of the jest is in strong contrast to some of thecomedies of a more modern school. It is on the detected culprits, not onthe injured husband, that the ridicule of gods and men is mercilesslyshowered. When the ballet is concluded, two of the king’s sons, at theirfather’s bidding, perform a sort of minuet, in which ball-play isintroduced. Ulysses expresses his admiration of the whole performance inwords which sound like solemn irony:--   “O king, pre-eminent in word and deed,    Of late thy lips the threatening vaunt did make    That these thy dancers all the world exceed--    Now have I seen fulfilment of thy rede;    Yea, wonder holds me while I gaze thereon.”So all passes off with pleasant compliments between hosts and guest. Theking and his twelve peers present Ulysses with costly gifts, andEuryalus, in pledge of regret for his late unseemly speech, offers hisown silver-hilted sword with its ivory scabbard.From the games they pass again to the banquet; and one more glimpse isgiven us of the gentle Nausicaa, perfectly in keeping with the maidenguilelessness of her character. Ulysses--still radiant with the morethan human beauty which the goddess has bestowed upon him--moves to hisplace in the hall.      “He from the bath, cleansed from the dust of toil,      Passed to the drinkers; and Nausicaa there      Stood, moulded by the gods exceeding fair.      She on the roof-tree pillar leaning, heard      Odysseus; turning, she beheld him near.      Deep in her breast admiring wonder stirred,    And in a low sweet voice she spake this winged word.      “‘Hail, stranger-guest! when fatherland and wife      Thou shalt revisit, then remember me,      Since to me first thou owest the price of life.’      And to the royal virgin answered he:      ‘Child of a generous sire, if willed it be      By Thunderer Zeus, who all dominion hath,      That I my home and dear return yet see,      There at thy shrine will I devote my breath,    There worship thee, dear maid, my saviour from dark death.’”It is not easy to discover, with any certainty, what the Greek poetmeant us to understand as to the feelings of Nausicaa towards Ulysses.It has been said that Love, in the complex modern acceptation of theterm, is unknown to the Greek poets. Nor is there, in this passage, anyapproach to the expression of such a feeling on the part of theprincess. Yet, had the scene found place in the work of a modern poet,we should have understood at once that, without any kind of reproach tothe perfect maidenly delicacy of Nausicaa, it was meant to show us thedawn of a tender sentiment--nothing more--towards the stranger-guestwhom the gods had endowed with such majestic graces of person, who stoodso high above all rivals in feats of strength and skill, whosemisfortunes surrounded him with a double interest, and, above all, inwhom she felt a kind of personal property as his deliverer.The Greek historian Plutarch chivalrously defends the young princessfrom the charge of forwardness, which ungallant critics brought againsther as early as his day. It was no marvel, he says, that she knew andvalued a hero when she saw him, and preferred him to the carpet-knightsof her own country, who were good only at the dance and the banquet. Butwith her it was, after all, a sentiment, and no more; but which mighthave ripened into love, under other circumstances, had the hero of hermaiden fancy been as free to choose as she was.So vanishes from the page one of the sweetest creations of Greekfiction--the more charming to us, as coming nearest, perhaps, of all tothe modern type of feeling. The farewell to Nausicaa is briefly said;and Ulysses, sitting by King Alcinous at the banquet, pays a highcompliment to the blind minstrel, and gives him a new theme for song.Since he knows so well the story of the great Siege, let him now takehis lyre, and sing to them of the wondrous Horse. Demodocus obeys. Hesings how the Greeks, hopeless of taking Troy by force of arms, hadrecourse at last to stratagem: how they constructed a huge framework inthe shape of a horse, ostensibly an offering to the gods, and then setfire to their sea-camp, and sailed away--for home, to allappearance--leaving an armed company hidden in the womb of the woodenmonster; how the Trojans, after much doubt, dragged it inside theirwalls, and how, in the night-time, the Greeks issued from their strangeambush, and spread fire and sword through the devoted city. And allalong Ulysses is the hero of the lay. He is the leader of the venturousband who thus carried their lives in their hands into the midst of theirenemies: he it is who, “like unto Mars,” storms the house of Deiphobus,who had taken Helen to wife after the death of his brother Paris, andrestores the Spartan princess to her rightful lord. Tears of emotionagain fill the listener’s eyes; and again the courteous king bids theminstrel cease, when he sees that some chord of mournful remembrance isstruck in the heart of his guest. But he now implores him, as he hasgood right to do, to tell them who he really is. Why does the Tale ofTroy so move him? The answer, replies the stranger, will be a long tale,and sad to tell; but his very name, he proudly says, is a history--“I amUlysses, son of Laertes!”CHAPTER IV.ULYSSES TELLS HIS STORY TO ALCINOUS.The narrative, which Ulysses proceeds to relate to his host, takes backhis story to the departure of the Greek fleet from Troy. First, on hishomeward course, he and his comrades had landed on the coast of Thrace,and laid waste the town of the Ciconians. Instead of putting to seaagain with their plunder, the crews stayed to feast on the capturedbeeves and the red wine. “Wrapt in the morning mist,” large bodies ofthe natives surprised them at this disadvantage, and they had tore-embark with considerable loss. This was the beginning of theirtroubles. They were rounding the southern point of Greece, when a stormbore them out far to sea, and not until sunset on the tenth day did theyreach an unknown shore--the land of the Lotus-eaters--      “Who, on the green earth couched beside the main,    Seemed ever with sweet food their lips to entertain.”To determine the geography of the place is as difficult as to ascertainthe natural history of the lotus, though critics have been veryconfident in doing both.[34] The effect of the seductive food on thecompanions of Ulysses is thus described:--      “And whoso tasted of their flowery meat      Cared not with tidings to return, but clave      Fast to that tribe, for ever fain to eat,    Reckless of home-return, the tender Lotus sweet.”Those who ate of it had to be dragged back by main force to theirgalleys, and bound fast with thongs, so loath were they to leave thatshore of peaceful rest and forgetfulness. In the words of our own poet,who has founded one of the most imaginative of his poems on thisincident of Ulysses’ voyage, so briefly told by Homer--   “Most weary seemed the sea, weary the oar,    Weary the wandering fields of barren foam.    Then some one said--‘We will return no more:’    And all at once they sang--‘Our island-home    Is far beyond the wave; we will no longer roam.’”[35]It has been thought that here we have possibly the bread-fruit tree ofthe South Sea Islands, with some hint of the effect produced by theirsoft and enervating climate, and that the voyage of Ulysses anticipatedin some degree the discoveries of Anson and Cook. It is curious that, inCook’s case, the seductions of those islands gave him the same troubleas they did Ulysses; for several of his crew thought, like the Greeksailors, that they had found an earthly paradise for which theydetermined to forget home and country, and had to be brought back totheir ship by force. But the lotus-land of the poet is an ideal shore,to which some of us moderns may have travelled as well as Ulysses. Itsdeepest recesses will have been reached by the Buddhist who attains hiscoveted state of perfect beatitude, the “Nirvâna,” in which a man hasfound out that all having and being, and more especially doing, are amistake. It is the _dolce far niente_ of the Italian; the region freefrom all cares and responsibilities--“beyond the domain ofconscience”--which Charles Lamb, half in jest and half in earnest,sighed for.Bearing away from the shore of the Lotus-eaters, Ulysses and his crewnext reached the island where the Cyclops dwell--a gigantic tribe ofrude shepherds, monsters in form, having but one eye planted in thecentre of their foreheads, who know neither laws, nor arts, norcommerce. Adventure and discovery have always a charm for Ulysses; andit was with no other motive, as he pretty plainly confesses, that helanded with his own ship’s crew to explore these unknown regions. Thepresent adventure had a horrible conclusion for some of his companions.Alone, in a vast cave near the shore, dwelt the giant Polyphemus, a sonof Neptune the sea-god, and folded his flocks in its deep recesses. Theydid not find the monster within: but the pails of brimming milk, andhuge piles of cheese, stood ranged in order round the walls of thecavern. Nothing would satisfy Ulysses but to await the owner’s return.At evening he came, driving his flocks before him; and, as was his wont,began to busy himself in his dairy operations. By the red glow of thefirelight he soon discovered the intruders, as they crouched in acorner. In vain they made appeal to his hospitality, reminding him thatstrangers were under the special care of Jupiter. What care the Cyclopsrace for the gods? So he seized two of the unhappy Greeks, dashed themon the ground--“like puppies”--devoured them, blood, bones, and all,after the manner of giants, and washed down his horrible supper withhuge bowls of milk. Two more furnished him with breakfast in themorning. But the craft of Ulysses was more than a match for the savage.He had carried with him on his dangerous expedition (having a kind ofpresentiment that it would prove useful) a skin of wine of rare qualityand potency, and of this he gave Polyphemus to drink after his lastcannibal meal. Charmed with the delicious draught, the giant begged toknow his benefactor’s name. The answer of Ulysses is the oldest specimenon record of the art of punning.      “‘Hear then; my name is Noman. From of old      My father, mother, these my comrades bold,      Give me this title.’ So I spake, and he      Answered at once with mind of ruthless mould:      ‘This shall fit largess unto Noman be--    Last, after all thy peers, I promise to eat thee.”Then, overcome by the potent drink, the savage lay down to sleep.Ulysses had prepared the thin end of a huge club of olive-wood, andthis, pointed and well hardened in the fire, he and his comrades thrustinto his single eye-ball, boring it deep in, “as the shipwright doth anauger.” Roaring with pain, and now fairly sobered, Polyphemus awoke, andshouted for help to his brother-Cyclops who dwelt in the neighbouringvalleys. They came; but to all their questions as to what was thematter, or who had injured him, he only answered “_Noman!_”--and hisfriends turned away in disgust. After groping vainly round the cave insearch of his tormentors, Polyphemus rolled the huge stone from themouth of his den, and let his sheep go out, feeling among them for hiscaptives, who would probably try thus to escape. But again the wit ofthe Ithacan chief proved too subtle for his enemy. The great sheep hadbeen cunningly linked together three abreast, and every middle sheepcarried a Greek tied under his belly; Ulysses, after tying the last ofhis companions, clinging fast to the wool of a huge ram, the king of theflock. So did they all escape to rejoin their anxious comrades. But whenall had embarked, and rowed to a safe distance, then Ulysses stood highupon his deck, and shouted a taunting defiance to his enemy. The answerof Polyphemus was a huge rock hurled with all his might towards thevoice, which fell just short of the vessel. Again Ulysses shouted, andbade him tell those who should hereafter ask him who did the deed, thatit was even Ulysses the Ithacan. The Cyclops groaned with rage andgrief--an ancient oracle had forewarned him of the name; but will thegreat Ulysses please to return, that he may entertain such a herohandsomely? He would have shown himself more simple than his enemy if hehad. Then the blind monster lifted his cry to his great father theSea-god, and implored his vengeance on his destroyer.The one-eyed giant of Homer’s story became a very popular comiccharacter in classical fiction. The only specimen of the old Greeksatyric drama, as it was called--a peculiar kind of comedy, in whichsatyrs were largely introduced--is a play by Euripides, ‘The Cyclops,’in which the principal incident is the blinding of Polyphemus byUlysses. The monster rushes out of his cave, with his eye-socket burntand bleeding, and stretches his arms across the entrance to interceptthe escape of Ulysses, who creeps out between his legs. He roars outwith pain, and is taunted by the “Chorus,”--a party of satyrs whom hehas made his slaves, and who now rejoice in their deliverance.“_Chorus._ Why make this bawling, Cyclops?_Cyclops._                                 I am lost!_Ch._ Thou’rt dirty, anyhow._Cyc._                       Yea, and wretched too!_Ch._ What! hast got drunk, and fallen into the fire?_Cyc._ Noman hath slain me!_Ch._                       Then thou’rt wronged by no man._Cyc._ Noman hath blinded me!_Ch._                          Then thou’rt not blind._Cyc._ Would ye were so!--_Ch._                      Why, how could _no man_ blind thee?_Cyc._ Ye mock me.--Where is Noman?_Ch._                               Nowhere, Cyclops._Cyc._ O friends, if ye would know the truth, yon wretch       Hath been my ruin--gave me drink, and drowned me!_Ch._ Ay--wine is strong, we know, and hard to deal with.The poet Theocritus, in one of his Idylls, gives us Polyphemus, beforehis blindness, in love with the beautiful nymph Galatæa, who, havinganother lover with two eyes in the young shepherd Acis, does notencourage the addresses of the Cyclops. This is part of hisremonstrance:--   “I know, sweet maiden, why thou art so coy;    Shaggy and huge, a single eyebrow spans    From ear to ear my forehead, whence one eye    Gleams, and an o’er-broad nostril o’er my lip.    Yet I--this monster--feed a thousand sheep,    That yield me sweetest draughts at milking-tide.           *       *       *       *       *    But thou mislik’st my hair?--Well, oaken logs    Are here, and embers yet a-glow with fire;    Burn, if thou wilt, my heart out, and my eye--    My lonely eye, wherein is my delight.”            --Theocritus, Idyll xi. (Calverley’s transl.)This love-story of the Cyclops is better known, perhaps, to Englishreaders, through Handel’s Pastoral, ‘Acis and Galatæa.’The imprecation of Polyphemus was heard, and Ulysses was long to sufferthe penalty of his bold deed. Yet, but for the weakness of his comrades,he might perhaps have escaped it. For, as they sailed on over unknownseas, they won the friendship of the King of the Winds. He feasted thema whole month on his brass-bound island; and he, too, like all the worldof gods and men, asked eagerly for the last news of the heroes of Troy.So charmed was Æolus with his guest, that on his departure he presentedUlysses with an ox-hide tied with a silver cord, in which all the windswere safely confined, save only Zephyr, who was left loose to waft thevoyagers safely home. So for nine days and nights they ran straight forIthaca, Ulysses himself at the helm, for he would trust it to no otherhand. And now they had come in sight of the rocks of their belovedisland--so near that they could see the smoke go up from the herdsmen’scamp-fires; when, overcome with long watching, the chief fell asleepupon the deck. Then the greed and curiosity of his companions temptedthem to examine the ox-hide bag. It must be some rich treasure, surely,thus carefully tied up and stowed away. They opened it; out rushed theimprisoned blasts, and drove them back in miserable plight to the islandof Æolus,--much to that monarch’s astonishment. In vain did Ulysses tellhis unlucky story, and beg further help from the ruler of the storms;Æolus would have nothing more to do with such an ill-starred wretch,upon whom there rested so manifestly the curse of heaven, but drove himand his companions out to sea again with ignominy.A second time the voyagers fell into the hands of cannibals. They mooredtheir ships in the harbour of the Læstrygonians,--in the description ofwhich there has been lately traced a strong likeness to the bay ofBalaclava--                      “A rock-surrounded bay,    Whence fronting headlands at the mouth outrun,    Leaving a little narrow entrance-way,    Wherethrough they drive the vessels one by one.”These Læstrygonians were a giant race, like the Cyclops, and of anequally barbarous character. One of the exploring party, whom Ulyssessent to reconnoitre, they seized and devoured on the spot, and thenhurled rocks down on the ships as they lay moored in the land-lockedharbour, and speared the unfortunate crews, “like fish,” as they swamfrom the wrecks. Ulysses only had moored outside, and escaped with hissingle ship by cutting his cable.Pursuing his sad voyage, he had reached the island of Ææa, where dweltthe enchantress Circe “of the bright hair,” daughter of the Sun. Here hedivided his small remaining force into two bands, one of which, underhis lieutenant, Eurylochus, explored the interior of the island, whileUlysses and the rest kept guard by their ship. Hidden deep in the woods,they came upon the palace of Circe.      “Wolves of the mountain all around the way,      And lions, softened by the spells divine,      As each her philters had partaken, lay.      These cluster round the men’s advancing line      Fawning like dogs, who, when their lord doth dine,      Wait till he issues from the banquet-hall,      And for the choice gifts which his hands assign      Fawn, for he ne’er forgets them--so these all    Fawn on our friends, whom much the unwonted sights appal.      “Soon at her vestibule they pause, and hear      A voice of singing from a lovely place,      Where Circe weaves her great web year by year,      So shining, slender, and instinct with grace      As weave the daughters of immortal race.”The abode of Circe presents quite a different picture from the grotto ofCalypso.[36] There, all the beauties were those of nature in heruntouched luxuriance; here we have all the splendour of an Orientalinterior, enriched with elaborate art--wide halls of polished marble,silver-studded couches, and vessels of gold.Throwing wide the shining doors, the enchantress gaily bade them enter;and all, save only the more prudent Eurylochus, accepted the invitation.They drank of her drugged cup; then she struck them with her wand, andlo! they became swine in form, yet retaining their human senses.Eurylochus, after long watching in vain for the reappearance of hiscomrades, returned alone with his strange tale to his chief, who at onceset forth to the rescue. On his way through the forest, he was suddenlyaccosted by a fair youth, bearing a wand of gold--none other than thegod Mercury--who gave him a root of wondrous virtue--    “Black, with a milk-white flower, in heavenly tongue     Called Moly.”[37]Armed with this, he can defy all Circe’s enchantments. She mixed for himthe same draught, struck him with her wand, and bid him “go herd withhis companions;” but potion and spell had lost their power. Circe hadfound her master, and knew it could be no other than “the many-wiledUlysses,” of whose visit she had been forewarned. Not even the magicvirtues of the herb Moly, however, enable him to resist her profferedlove; and Ulysses, by his own confession, forgot Penelope in the hallsof Circe, as afterwards in the island of Calypso. It may be offered ashis apology, that it was absolutely necessary for him to make himselfagreeable to his hostess, in order to obtain from her (as he does atonce) the deliverance of his companions from her toils; but this doesnot explain his sending for the rest of his crew from the ship, andspending a whole year in her society. The ingenious critics who insiston shaping a moral allegory out of the story of the Odyssey confess tohaving found a stumbling-block in this point of the narrative. It soundsvery plausible to say that in Circe is personified sensual pleasure;that those who partake of her cup, and are turned into swine, are thosewho brutalise themselves by such indulgences; that the herb Moly--blackat the root, but white and beautiful in the blossom--symbolises“instruction” or “temperance,” by which the temptations of sense are tobe resisted. But Ulysses’ victory over the enchantress, and hissubsequent relations to her, fall in but awkwardly with any moral of anykind. To say that Ulysses knows how to indulge his appetites withmoderation, and therefore escapes the penalties of excess--that he isthe master of Pleasure, while his companions become its slaves--is tomake the parable teach a very questionable form of morality indeed,since it represents self-indulgence as praiseworthy, if we can onlymanage to escape the consequences.But it was not until Ulysses had been reminded by his companions that hewas forgetting his fatherland, that he besought his fair entertainer tolet him go. Reluctantly she consented, bound by her oath--warning him,as they parted, that toil and peril lay before him, and that if he wouldlearn his future fate, he must visit the Regions of the Dead, and thereconsult the shade of the great prophet Tiresias.Ulysses goes on to describe to the king of the Phæacians his voyage onfrom the island of Ææa, under the favouring gales which Circe sendshim:--     “All the day long the silvery foam we clave,      Wind in the well-stretched canvas following free,      Till the sun stooped beneath the western wave,      And darkness veiled the spaces of the sea.      Then to the limitary land came we      Of the sea-river, streaming deep, where dwell,      Shrouded in mist and gloom continually,      That people, from sweet light secluded well,    The dark Cimmerian tribe, who skirt the realms of hell.”Who these Cimmerians were is not easily discoverable. Their name washeld by the Greeks a synonym for all that was dark and barbarous in themists of antiquity. It appears, nevertheless, in the earlier historiansas the appellation of a real people; some rash ethnologists, temptedchiefly by the similarity of name, have tried to identify them with theCymry--the early settlers of Wales. The Welsh are notoriously proud oftheir ancient origin, but it is doubtful how far they would accept thepoet’s description of their ancestral darkness, or the neighbourhood towhich he here assigns them.CHAPTER V.THE TALE CONTINUED--THE VISIT TO THE SHADES.The eleventh book of the poem, in which Ulysses goes down to the Shadesto consult the Dead, has been considered by some good authorities as alater interpolation into the tale. The solemn grandeur of the wholeepisode is remarked as out of character with the light and easynarrative into which it has been woven. Be this as it may, the passagehas a strong interest in itself. It is the solitary glimpse which wehave of the poet’s creed as to the state of disembodied spirits. It isat least not in contradiction to the views which are disclosed--scantilyenough--by the author of the Iliad, though here we find themconsiderably more developed. It is a gloomy picture at the best; and wealmost cease to wonder at the shrinking from death which is so oftendisplayed by the Homeric heroes, when we find their future staterepresented as something almost worse, to an active mind, thanannihilation.    “Never the Sun that giveth light to men     Looks down upon them with his golden eye,     Or when he climbs the starry arch, or when     Slope toward the earth he wheels adown the sky;     But sad night weighs upon them wearily.”They reached the spot, says Ulysses, described to him at parting byCirce, where the dark rivers Acheron and Cocytus mix at the entranceinto Hades. The incantations which she had carefully enjoined were dulymade; a black ram and ewe were offered to the powers of darkness, andtheir blood poured into the trench which he had dug--“a cubit everyway.”     “Forthwith from Erebus a phantom crowd      Loomed forth, the shadowy people of the dead,--      Old men, with load of earthly anguish bowed,      Brides in their bloom cut off, and youths unwed,      Virgins whose tender eyelids then first shed      True sorrow, men with gory arms renowned,      Pierced by the sharp sword on the death-plain red.      All these flock darkling with a hideous sound,    Lured by the scent of blood, the open trench around.”But he had been charged by Circe not to allow the ghastly crew to slaketheir thirst, until he had evoked the shade of Tiresias, the blindprophet of Thebes, who retained his art and his honours even in theseregions of the dead. So he kept them off with his sword,--not sufferingeven the phantom of his dead mother Anticleia, who came among the rest,to taste, until the great prophet appeared, leaning on his golden staff.                          “To the bloody brink    He stooped, and with his shadowy lips made shrink    The sacrificial pool that darkling lay    Beneath him.”From the lips of Tiresias Ulysses has learnt the future which awaitshim. On the coast of Sicily he should find pasturing the herds andflocks of the Sun: if he and his comrades left them uninjured, theyshould soon see again their native Ithaca; if they laid sacrilegioushands on them, he alone should escape, and reach home after longsuffering.The shade of his mother has been sitting meanwhile in gloomy silence,eyeing the coveted blood. Not until she had drank of it might she openher lips to speak, or have power to recognise her son. To his eagerinquiries as to her own fate and that of his father Laertes she madeanswer that she herself had died of grief, and that the old man waswearing out a joyless life in bitter anxiety.    “Therewith she ended, and a deep unrest     Urged me to clasp the spirit of the dead,     And fold a phantom to my yearning breast.     Thrice I essayed, with eager hands out-spread     Thrice like a shadow or a dream she fled,     And my hands closed on unsubstantial air.”As they talked together, there swept forth out of the gloom a crowd offemale shapes--the mothers of the mighty men of old. There came Tyro,beloved by the sea-god Neptune, from whom sprang Neleus, father ofNestor: next followed Antiope, who bore to Jupiter Amphion and Zethus,who built the seven-gated Thebes; Iphimedeia, mother of the giants Otusand Ephialtes, who strove to take heaven itself by storm; Alcmena, Leda,Ariadne, and a crowd of the heroines of Greek romance, who had found theloves of the gods more or less disastrous in their earthly lot, and whowere reaping, in the gloomy immortality which the poet assigns them,such consolation as they might from knowing themselves the mothers ofheroes.Here Ulysses would have ended his tale, and for a while a charmedsilence falls upon his Phæacian audience. But the king would hear more.Did he see, in the realms of the dead, no one of those renownedchampions who had fought with him at Troy?Yes--if his host cares to listen, Ulysses can tell him a sad tale ofsome of his old comrades. He saw the great Agamemnon there, and heardfrom his lips the treachery of the adulterous Clytemnestra. Antilochusand Patroclus, too, he had recognised, and Ajax; but the latter,retaining in the world below the animosities of earthly life, had stoodfar aloof, and sullenly refused to speak a word in answer to hissuccessful rival. The only one who reveals anything of the secrets ofhis prison-house is Achilles. He asks of his adventurous visitor whathas prompted him to risk this intrusion into the gloomy dwelling, wherethe dead live indeed, but without thought or purpose, mere shadows ofwhat they were. And when Ulysses attempts to comfort him with thethought of the deathless glory which surrounds his name, thehopelessness of his answer sets forth, in the darkest colours, thatgloomy view of human destiny which breaks out from time to time in thecreed of the poet, and which belongs to the character of his favouritehero. Whether the Odyssey did or did not come from the same hand as theIliad, at least Achilles is the same in both. In the former poem wefind him indulging in all the mournful irony of the Hebrew Preacher, inhis perplexed thought before he was led to “the conclusion of the wholematter”--complaining, like him, that “one event happeneth to all,” andthat “the wise man dieth as the fool;” that he, the bravest and mostbeautiful of living heroes, would have to meet the same lot as hisvictim Lycaon; so here, in the Odyssey, he adopts the text that “aliving dog is better than a dead lion:”--   “Rather would I, in the sun’s warmth divine,    Serve some poor churl who drags his days in grief,    Than the whole lordship of the dead were mine.”Such was the immortality to which Paganism condemned even its best andbravest.One touching inquiry both Agamemnon and Achilles put to their visitorfrom the upper world. How fare their sons? Where is Orestes?--asks thegreat king. Did Neoptolemus, in the later days of the war, prove himselfworthy of his father?--inquires Achilles. When he has been assured ofthis, the shade of the mighty hero, well satisfied,    “Passed striding through the fields of asphodel.”There is no distinct principle of reward or punishment discernible inthe regions of the dead, as seen by Ulysses. Indeed, anything likehappiness in this shadowy future seems incompatible with the feelingsput into the mouth of Achilles. Orion, the mighty hunter, appears toenjoy something like the Red Indian’s paradise--pursuing, in thoseshadowy fields, the phantoms of the wild creatures which he slew onearth; but, with this exception, there is no hint of pleasurableinterest or occupation for the mighty dead. Punishments there are fornotorious offenders against the majesty of the gods:--     “There also Tantalus in anguish stood,      Plunged in the stream of a translucent lake;      And to his chin welled ever the cold flood.      But when he rushed, in fierce desire to break      His torment, not one drop could he partake.      For as the old man stooping seems to meet      That water with his fiery lips, and slake      The frenzy of wild thirst, around his feet,    Leaving the dark earth dry, the shuddering waves retreat.     “Also the thick-leaved arches overhead      Fruit of all savour in profusion flung,      And in his clasp rich clusters seemed to shed.      There citrons waved, with shining fruitage hung,      Pears and pomegranates, olive ever young,      And the sweet-mellowing fig: but whensoe’er      The old man, fain to cool his burning tongue,      Clutched with his fingers at the branches fair,    Came a strong wind and whirled them skyward through the air.”     “And I saw Sisyphus in travail strong      Shove with both hands a mighty sphere of stone:      With feet and sinewy wrists he, labouring long,      Just pushed the vast globe up, with many a groan;      But when he thought the huge mass to have thrown      Clean o’er the summit, the enormous weight      Back to the nether plain rolled tumbling down.      He, straining, the great toil resumed, while sweat    Bathed each laborious limb, and his brow smoked with heat.”Both these are examples of punishment inflicted in the Shades below, notfor an evil life, but for personal offences against the sovereign of thegods. Tantalus had been admitted as a guest to the banquet of theimmortals, and had stolen their nectar and ambrosia to give to hisfellow-men. Sisyphus had been, it is true, a notorious robber on earth,but the penalty assigned him was for the higher crime of betraying anamour of Jupiter’s which had come to his knowledge. The stone ofSisyphus has been commonly taken as an illustration of labour spent invain; but a modern English poet has found in it a beautiful illustrationof the indestructibility of hope. In one of Lord Lytton’s ‘Tales ofMiletus,’ when Orpheus visits the Shades in search of his lost wife--   “He heard, tho’ in the midst of Erebus,    Song sweet as his Muse-mother made his own;    It broke forth from a solitary ghost,            Who, up a vaporous hill,    “Heaved a huge stone that came rebounding back,    And still the ghost upheaved it and still sang.    In the brief pause from toil while towards the height            Reluctant rolled the stone,    “The Thracian asked in wonder, ‘Who art thou,    Voiced like Heaven’s lark amidst the night of Hell?’    ‘My name on earth was Sisyphus,’ replied            The phantom. ‘In the Shades    “I keep mine earthly wit; I have duped the Three.[38]    They gave me work for torture; work is joy.    Slaves work in chains, and to the clank they sing.’            Said Orpheus, ‘Slaves still hope!’    “‘And could I strain to heave up the huge stone    Did I not hope that it would reach the height?    There penance ends, and dawn Elysian fields.’            ‘But if it never reach?’    “The Thracian sighed, as looming through the mist    The stone came whirling back. ‘Fool,’ said the ghost,    ‘Then mine, at worst, is everlasting hope.’            Again uprose the stone.”Ulysses confesses that he did not see all he might have seen; for, whenthe pale ghosts in their ten thousands crowded round him with wildcries, the hero lost courage, fled back to his ship, and bade hiscomrades loose their cables, and put out at once to sea.They passed the island where the twin sisters, the Sirens, lay couchedin flowers, luring all passing mariners to their destruction by thefascination of their song. Forewarned by Circe, the chief had stoppedthe ears of all his crew with melted wax, and had made them bind him tothe mast, giving them strict charge on no account to release him,however he might entreat or threaten--for he himself, true to hispassion for adventure, would fain listen to these dangerousenchantresses. So, as they drifted close along the shore, the Sirenslifted their voices and sang as follows--every word of Mr Worsley’stranslation is Homer’s, except the single phrase in brackets:--      “Hither, Odysseus, great Achaian name,      Turn thy swift keel, and listen to our lay;      Since never pilgrim to these regions came      In black ship [on the azure waves astray],      But heard our sweet voice ere he sailed away,      And in his joy passed on, with ampler mind.      We know what labours were in ancient day      Wrought in wide Troia, as the gods assigned;    We know from land to land all toils of all mankind.”But the deaf crew rowed on, and not until the sound of the strain haddied away in the distance did they unbind their captain, in spite of hisangry protests. They pass the strait that divides Sicily fromItaly, where on either hand lurked the monsters Scylla andCharybdis--impersonations, it may be, of rocks and whirlpools--but whichthey escaped, with the loss of six out of the crew, by help of Circe’swarnings and directions. But that our own Spenser’s ‘Faery Queen’ isperhaps even less known to the majority of English readers than theOdyssey of Homer (by grace of popular translations), it might beneedless to remind them how the whole of Sir Guyon’s voyage on the “IdleLake” is nothing more or less than a reproduction of this portion ofUlysses’ adventures.[39] The five mermaidens, who entrap unwarytravellers with their melody, address the knight as he floats by in astrain which is the echo of the Sirens’--     “O thou fayre son of gentle Fäery,      That art in mightie arms most magnifyde      Above all knights that ever batteill tryde,      O turn thy rudder hitherwarde awhile:      Here may thy storme-bett vessell safely ryde:      This is the port of rest from troublous toyle,    The worldes sweet Inn from pain and wearisome turmoyle.”The enchantress Acrasia, with her transformed lovers--the “seemingbeasts who are men in deed”--is but a copy from Circe; while the “Gulfof Greediness” yawning on one side of the Lake--    “That deep engorgeth all this worldës prey”--and on the other side the “Rock of Vile Reproach,” whose fatal magneticpower draws in all who try to shun the whirlpool opposite, are theScylla and Charybdis of Homer.At length the voyagers reached the shore where the oxen of the Sun werepastured. In vain did Ulysses, remembering the prophecy of Tiresias, bidthem steer on and leave the land unvisited. Eurylochus, his lieutenant,broke out at last into something like mutiny. He had some show ofreason, when he complained of his chief, almost in the words of SirDinadan to Sir Tristram in the ‘Morte d’Arthur,’ that he was tired ofsuch mad company, and would no longer follow a man to whose iron framethe toils and dangers which wore out ordinary mortals were a meredisport. Seeing that the rest backed Eurylochus in his proposal to landand rest, Ulysses was fain to give way, after exacting a vow that atleast none of them should lay sacrilegious hands upon the sacred herds,since they had store of corn and wine, the parting gifts of Circe, onboard their vessel. But stress of weather detained them in the anchoragea whole month, until corn and wine were exhausted, and they had to snarebirds and catch fish--a kind of food which a Greek seaman especiallydespised--to keep them from starving. Then at last, while their chiefhad withdrawn to a quiet spot, and fallen asleep wearied with longprayer, Eurylochus persuaded the rest to break their vow, and slay thechoicest of the oxen. Terrible prodigies followed the unhallowed meal;the skins of the slain animals moved and crawled after their slayers,and the meat, while roasting on the spits, uttered fearful cries andgroans. One of the old allegorical interpreters has drawn from thisincident a moral which, however fanciful, is not without a certainbeauty and appositeness of illustration--the sins of the wicked, hesays, dog their steps, and cry aloud against them. When next they put tosea, Jupiter raised winds and waves to punish them; for the Sun hadthreatened that, if such insult went unavenged, he would light theheavens no more, but go down and shine in Hades. Their ship was riven bya thunderbolt, and Ulysses alone, sole survivor of all his crew, afteronce more narrowly escaping the whirlpool of Charybdis, after floatingnine days upon the broken mast, was cast ashore on the island ofCalypso, and there detained until his release by the intercession ofMinerva, as has been told, which had ended in this second shipwreck onthe coast of his present entertainers.CHAPTER VI.ULYSSES’ RETURN TO ITHACA.The hero, at his departure, is loaded with rich presents of honour fromhis Phæacian hosts. The twelve princes of the kingdom each contributetheir offering--gold and changes of raiment; the king adds a golddrinking-cup of his own, and Queen Arete a mantle and tunic. The carefulqueen also supplies him with a magnificent chest, in which she packs histreasures with her own royal hands; and Ulysses secures the whole with a“seaman’s knot,” whose complications will defy the uninitiated--a secretwhich he has learnt from Circe, and which he seems to have handed downto modern sailors. Thus equipped, he is sent on board one of the magicgalleys, to be conveyed home to his native Ithaca. They embark in theevening, and early the next morning the crew--apparently in order togive the adventure the half-ludicrous turn which seems inseparable fromthe Phæacians--land their passenger, still sound asleep, and leave himon shore under an olive-tree, with his store of presents heaped besidehim. When he awakes, he fails to recognise his native island, forMinerva has spread a mist over it. The goddess herself presentlyaccosts him, in the form of a shepherd, and listens patiently to a storywhich the hero invents, with his usual readiness, to account for hispresence on the island. Then she discovers herself, with a somewhatironical compliment on the inveterate craftiness which has led him toattempt to impose on the wisest of the immortals. She tells him news ofhis wife and of his son, and promises him her help against the accursedsuitors. She lays her golden wand upon him, and lo! the majesticpresence which had touched the maiden fancy of Nausicaa, and won himfavour in the eyes of the Phæacian court (to say nothing of Circe andCalypso) has at once given place to the decrepitude of age. The ruddycheeks grow wrinkled, the bright eyes are dimmed, the flowing locksturned grey, and Ulysses is, to all appearance, an aged beggar, clad insqualid rags. Thus disguised, so that none shall recognise him till hishour comes, he seeks shelter, by direction of the goddess, with his ownswineherd Eumæus.Eumæus is one of the most characteristic personages in the poem, and hasgiven the most trouble to the poet’s various critics. He occupies a sortof forester’s lodge in the woods, where the vast herds of swinebelonging to the absent king are fed by day, and carefully lodged atnight. Though he is but a keeper of swine, Homer applies to himcontinually the epithets “godlike,” and “chief of men,” which hecommonly uses only of territorial lords such as Ulysses and Menelaus. Henot only has subordinates in his employ, but an attendant slave, whom hehas purchased with his own money; and he so far exercises anindependent right of property in the animals which are under his care asto kill and dress them--two at a time, such is the lavish hospitality ofthe age--to feast the stranger-guest who has now come to him. It may bestraining a point to see in him, as one of the most genial of Homericcritics does, “a genuine country gentleman of the age of Homer;” but hisposition, so far as it is possible to compare it with anything at all inmodern social life, appears something like that of the agriculturalsteward of a large landed proprietor, with whom his relations, thoughstrictly subordinate, are of a highly confidential and friendlycharacter. The charge of the swine would be a much more important officein an age when, as is plain from many passages both in the Iliad and theOdyssey, the flesh of those animals held a place of honour at thebanquets of chiefs and kings: and as we find that even the sons of aroyal household did not think the keeping of sheep beneath theirdignity, so the care of other animals would by no means imply a menialposition. Eumæus, indeed, turns out to be himself of princelybirth--stolen in his childhood by a treacherous nurse from the islandwhere his father was king, sold by Phœnician merchants to Laertes inIthaca, and brought up in his household almost as a son, and regardingthe lost Ulysses “as an elder brother.” Very loyal is he to the house ofhis benefactors; prefacing his meal by a prayer that his lord may yetreturn in safety, and grieving specially that the lady Penelope, in herpresent troubles, has seldom the opportunity to see or speak with him inthe kindly intercourse of old. The cordial and simple relations betweenmaster and servant--even though the servant was commonly nothing more orless than a purchased slave--are a striking feature, very pleasant todwell upon, in these Homeric poems. They remind us, as Homer does sooften, of similar pictures in the sacred narrative of the gentleraffections which redeemed so often the curse of slavery--of the littlecaptive Israelite maiden whose concern for her Syrian master led to hiscure, and of the faithful steward, “born in the house” of Abraham, whomthe childless patriarch once thought to make his heir.Eumæus entertains the stranger right hospitably--warning him, at thesame time, not to pretend, as others have often done in the hope ofreward, to bring tidings of the lost Ulysses. His guest’s own story hewill be glad to hear. The hero is always ready at narrative, whether thetale is to be fact or fiction. At present he chooses fiction; he giveshis listener an imaginary history of his past life, as a Cretan chiefwho had seen much good service in many lands, especially under KingIdomeneus at Troy, but who had met with a succession of disasters since.Of course he had seen and known Ulysses; had heard of him since the fallof Troy; and he offers his host a wager that he will yet return. Eumæuswill hear nothing of such flattering hopes; by this time his men arecoming in from the field, and when the swine are safely housed, supperand bedtime follow. But the night is bitter cold, and Ulysses hasnothing but his beggar’s rags. He indirectly begs a covering from hishost by an ingenious story, very characteristic of the style of thelighter episodes of the Odyssey. He relates an adventure of his ownwhile lying in ambush, one winter night, under the walls of Troy. DrMaginn’s translation of this passage, in the old English ballad style,though somewhat free, preserves fairly the spirit and humour of theoriginal:--    “Oh! were I as young and as fresh and as strong     As when under Troy, brother soldiers among,     In ambush as captains were chosen to lie     Odysseus and King Menelaus and I!    “They called me as third, and I came at the word,     And reached the high walls that the citadel gird;     When under the town we in armour lay down     By a brake in the marshes with weeds overgrown.     The night came on sharp, bleak the north wind did blow,     And frostily cold fell a thick shower of snow.    “Soon with icicles hoar every shield was frozen o’er;     But they who their cloaks and their body-clothes wore     The night lightly passed, secure from the blast,     Asleep with their shields o’er their broad shoulders cast;     But I, like a fool, had my cloak left behind,     Not expecting to shake in so piercing a wind.    “My buckler and zone--nothing more--had I on;     But when the third part of the night-watch was gone,     And the stars left the sky, with my elbow then I     Touched Odysseus, and spoke to him, lying close by--     Noble son of Laertes, Odysseus the wise,     I fear that alive I shall never arise.    “‘In this night so severe but one doublet I wear--     Deceived by a god--and my cloak is not here,     And no way I see from destruction to flee.’     But soon to relieve me a project had he.     In combat or council still prompt was his head,     And into my ear thus low whisp’ring he said:--    “‘Let none of the band this your need understand;     Keep silent.’ Then, resting his head on his hand,--     ‘Friends and comrades of mine,’ he exclaimed, ‘as a sign,     While I slept has come o’er me a dream all divine.     It has warned me how far from the vessels we lie,     And that some one should go for fresh force to apply;    “‘And his footsteps should lead, disclosing our need,     To King Agamemnon, our chieftain, with speed.’     Thoas rose as he spoke, flung off his red cloak,     And running, his way with the message he took;     While, wrapt in his garment, I pleasantly lay     Till the rise of the golden-throned queen of the day.    “‘If I now were as young, and as fresh, and as strong,     Perhaps here in the stables you swine-herds among     Some a mantle would lend, as the act of a friend,     Or from the respect that on worth should attend;     But small is the honour, I find, that is paid     To one who, like me, is so meanly arrayed.’”             --(Maginn’s ‘Homeric Ballads.’)The self-laudation which the hero, speaking in another person, takes theopportunity to introduce, is in perfect keeping with his characterthroughout.The hint so broadly given is quite successful, and Eumæus provides hisguest with some warm coverings and a place near the fire; but he himselfwill not sleep so far from his charge. Wrapped in a mighty wind-proofcloak, he takes up his quarters for the night under the shelter of arock, hard by the lair of his swine.CHAPTER VII.THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS FROM SPARTA.The story returns to Telemachus, whom we left at Sparta. His stay atthat court has been prolonged a whole month, for which the excuse, wemust suppose, is to be found in the hospitalities of Menelaus and thefascinations of Helen. No wonder that his guardian goddess admonisheshim in a dream that, under his present circumstances, such delays aredangerous. Penelope has a hard time of it in his absence, even herfather pressing her to marry some one of her suitors. Nay, Minerva morethan hints--though we beg our readers not to accept such an insinuationagainst Penelope, even on the authority of a goddess--that Eurymachus,one of the richest of the rivals, is beginning to find favour in hereyes. Telemachus is roused once more to action: awakening his youngfriend Pisistratus, he proposes that they should set out on their returnat once--before the day breaks. The son of the old “Horse-tamer”sensibly reminds him that driving in the dark is very undesirable, andit is agreed to wait for the morning. Menelaus, with genuine courtesy,refrains from any attempt to detain his guests longer than seemsagreeable to themselves. A portion of his speech, as rendered by Pope,has passed into a popular maxim as to the true limits of hospitality,and has been quoted, no doubt, by many, with very little idea that theywere indebted to Homer for the precept--   “True friendship’s laws are by this rule exprest--    Welcome the coming, speed the parting guest.”Another maxim of the hospitable Spartan has long been adopted byEnglishmen--that all wise men, who have a long day’s journey beforethem, should lay in a substantial breakfast. This the travellers do, andthen prepare to mount their chariot; Telemachus bearing with him, as theparting gift of his royal host, a bowl of silver wondrously chased, “thework of Vulcan”--too fair to come from any mortal hand--which Menelaushad himself received from the King of Sidon; while Helen adds anembroidered robe “that glistened like a star,” one of many which she haswoven with her own hands, which she begs him to keep to adorn his brideon her marriage-day. Even as they part, lo! there is an omen in thesky--an eagle bearing off a white goose in her talons. Who shall expoundit? Menelaus, who is appealed to, is no soothsayer. Helen alone canunlock the riddle:--   “Just as this eagle came from far away,    Reared in the bleak rock, nursling of the hill,    And in the stormy ravin of his wild will    Seized on the white goose, delicately bred,--    So brave Ulysses, after countless ill,    Comes from afar off, dealing vengeance dread.”Telemachus blesses her for the happy interpretation, and promises that,should the word come true, he will worship the fair prophetess in Ithacaas nothing less than a divinity. Whether or no he made good his vow thepoet does not tell us. Worse mortals have been canonised both in ancientand modern calendars. And whether Helen was honoured thus in Ithaca ornot, she certainly was at Sparta, where we are told that she displayedher new powers as a divinity once at least in a very appropriatemanner--transforming a child of remarkable ugliness, at the prayer ofits nurse, into a no less remarkable beauty.The young men make their first evening halt at Pheræ, as before, andreach Nestor’s court at Pylos next day. Telemachus insists on drivingstraight to the bay where his patient crew still await him with thegalley--for he knows old Nestor will try to detain him, out of kindness,if he once set foot again in the palace--and instantly on his arrivalthey hoist sail for home. They round the peninsula in the night, andwith the morning’s dawn they sight the spiry peaks of Ithaca. The crewmoor the vessel in a sheltered bay, while Telemachus--to escape theambuscade which he knows to have been laid for him--makes straight forthe swineherd’s lodge, instead of entering the town. As he draws nearthe threshold, the watch-dogs know his step, and run out to greet him;Eumæus himself, in his delight at the meeting, drops from his hands thebowl of wine which he was carefully mixing as a morning draught for hisdisguised guest, and falls on his young lord’s neck, kissing him, andweeping tears of joy.      “Thou, O Telemachus, my life, my light,      Returnest; yet my soul did often say      That never, never more should I have sight      Of thy sweet face, since thou didst sail away.      Enter, dear child, and let my heart allay      Its yearnings; newly art thou come from far:      Thou comest all too seldom--fain to stay      In the thronged city, where the suitors are,    Silently looking on while foes thy substance mar.”Ulysses preserves his disguise, and rises from his seat to offer it tothe young chief. But Telemachus, like all Homer’s heroes, isemphatically a gentleman; and he will not take an old man’s place,though that man be but a poor wayfarer clad in rags. When he has brokenhis fast at his retainer’s table, he would know from him who thestranger is. Eumæus repeats the fictitious history which he has heardfrom Ulysses, and Telemachus promises the shipwrecked wanderer reliefand protection. He sends Eumæus to announce his own safe return toPenelope; and when the father and son are left alone, suddenly Minervaappears--visible only to Ulysses and to the dogs, who cower and whine atthe supernatural presence--and bids him discover himself to his son. Thebeggar’s rags fall off, a royal robe takes their place, and he resumesall the majesty of presence which he had worn before. But Telemachusdoes not recognise the father whom he has never known; the suddentransformation rather suggests to him some heavenly visitant. He was butan infant when Ulysses went to Troy; and even when his father assureshim of his identity, he will not believe. There is a quiet sadness, butno reproach, in the hero’s reply:--   “Other Odysseus cometh none save me.    Behold me as I am! By earth and sea    Scourged with affliction, in the twentieth year,    Safe to mine own land at the last I flee.”It is long before either, in their first emotion, can find words to telltheir story. Ulysses takes his son fully into his counsels, and chargeshim to keep the news of his return as yet a secret even from his mother,until they two shall discover who among the household can be trusted toaid them in the extermination of the intruders and their powerfulretinue. He knows that his day of vengeance is come at last, and nothingless than this will satisfy him. Telemachus has some timorousmisgivings, according to his nature--What are they two against so many?But Ulysses knows that the gods are on his side--Minerva and the Fatherof the gods himself; or shall we say with the allegorists, in this case,the Counsels of Heaven and the Justice of Heaven? There is a grand ironyin the question which he puts to his son--“Thinkest thou these allieswill suffice, or shall we seek for other helpers?”CHAPTER VIII.ULYSSES REVISITS HIS PALACE.Great is the consternation amongst the riotous crew in the palace, whenthey find that Telemachus has escaped their toils, and has returned; andgreat the joy of Penelope when she hears this good news from Eumæus,which yet she hardly believes, until it is confirmed by a visit from herson in person. The suitors receive him with feigned courtesy, thoughsome among them have already determined on his assassination. Theswineherd follows to the palace, bringing with him, by command ofTelemachus, the seeming beggar--for Ulysses has undergone a secondtransformation, and is once more an aged man in mean apparel. As a poorwanderer, dependent on public charity, he is sure to find that readyadmittance into the royal precincts which is so necessary for carryingout his plans of vengeance, without raising the suspicions of thepresent occupants. On the way they are met by Melanthius the goatherd,whose character stands in marked contrast to that of Eumæus. He isutterly faithless to his absent master’s interests, and has become theready instrument of his enemies. With mocking insolence he jeers atEumæus and his humble acquaintance, and even goes so far as to spurn thelatter with his foot. Ulysses fully justifies his character for patienceand endurance; though for a moment he does debate in his heart thealternative, whether he should break the skull of the scoffer with hisclub, or lift him from his feet and dash his brains out on the ground.As he draws near the gates of his own palace he espies another oldretainer, of a different type, belonging to a race noted in all landsand ages for its fidelity. There lies on the dunghill, dying of old age,disease, and neglect, his dog Argus--the companion of many a long chasein happier days. The dog has all Eumæus’s loyalty, and more than hisdiscernment. His instinct at once detects his old master, even throughthe disguise lent by the goddess of wisdom. Before he sees him, he knowshis voice and step, and raises his ears--   “And when he marked Odysseus in the way,    And could no longer to his lord come near,    Fawned with his tail, and drooped in feeble play    His ears. Odysseus turning wiped a tear.”Eustathius (who made none the worse archbishop because he was a thoroughlover of Homer) has remarked, somewhat pertinently, that the fate of hisdog draws from the imperturbable Ulysses the tears which he never shedsfor any thought of Penelope. But such lesser pathetic incidents haveoften, in actual life, a stronger emotional effect than is produced bythe deeper affections.[40] But he masters his emotion, for this is notime to betray himself, and follows Eumæus through the entrance-doors.It is poor Argus’s last effort, and the old hound turns and dies--    “Just having seen Odysseus in the twentieth year.”The story is told by the Greek poet with somewhat more prolixity ofdetail than suits our modern notions of the pathetic, but the pathos ofthe incident itself is of the simplest and purest kind.In beggar’s guise Ulysses enters his own hall, and makes his rounds ofthe party who sit there at table, soliciting some contribution of brokenmeat to his wallet. None is so hard of heart as to refuse, exceptAntinous. In vain does Ulysses compliment him on his princely beauty,and remind him of the uncertainty of fortune, as evidenced by his ownpresent case:--      “Once to me also sorrow came not near,      And I had riches and a noble name,    And to the wandering poor still gave, whoever came.”      “Legions of slaves and many thousand things      I held, which God doth on the great bestow--      All that the ownership of large wealth brings.      But Zeus the Thunderer, for he willed it so,      Emptied my power, and sent a wave of woe.”Antinous haughtily bids him stand off, and when Ulysses expresses hiswonder that in so fair a body should dwell so mean a spirit, hurls astool at him. The blow does not shake the strong frame of Ulysses, whomoves to the doorway, lays down his wallet, and lifts his voice insolemn imprecation to the Powers on high who protect the stranger andthe poor:--      “Hear me, ye suitors of the queen divine!      Men grieve not for the wounds they take in fight,      Defending their own wealth, white sheep or kine;      But me (bear witness!) doth Antinous smite      Only because I suffer hunger’s bite,      Fount to mankind of evils evermore.      Now may Antinous, ere his nuptial night,      If there be gods and furies of the poor,    Die unavenged, unwept, upon the palace-floor.”Even some amongst the young man’s companions are horrified by thisreckless violation of the recognised laws of charity and hospitality.One of them speaks out in strong rebuke:--      “Not to thine honour hast thou now let fall,      Antinous, on the wandering poor this blow.      Haply a god from heaven is in our hall,      And thou art ripe for ruin: I bid thee know,      Gods in the garb of strangers to and fro      Wander the cities, and men’s ways discern;      Yea, through the wide earth in all shapes they go,      Changed, yet the same, and with their own eyes learn    How live the sacred laws--who hold them, and who spurn.”This is one of those noble passages in which the creed of the poet soarsfar above his mythology. The god who is the avenger of broken oaths, andthe protector of the poor and the stranger, though he bears the name ofZeus or Jupiter, is a power of very different type from the Ruler ofOlympus, who indulges his sensual passions in base amours withmortals,--who in the Iliad is perpetually engaged in domestic wrangleswith his queen, and even in the Odyssey wreaks a weak vengeance onUlysses merely to gratify the spite of Neptune.      “Meanwhile Telemachus sat far apart,      Feeding on fire; and deeper and more drear      Grew the sharp pang, that he saw stricken there      His own dear father, and the flower of kings.      Yet from his eyelids he let fall no tear,      But, filled in soul with dark imaginings,    Silently waved his head, and brooded evil things.”Additional insults await the hero in his own hall. There comes from thetown a sturdy beggar, known as Irus--“the messenger”--by a kind ofparody on the name of the rainbow goddess, Iris, who performs the sameoffice for the immortals. Jealous of a rival mendicant, such as Ulyssesappears, he threatens to drive him from the hall. Ulysses quietly warnshim to keep his hands off--there is room enough for both. The youngnobles shout with delight at a quarrel which promises such good sport,and at once form a ring for the combatants, and undertake to see fairplay. When the disguised king strips off his squalid rags for theboxing-match, and discovers the brawny chest and shoulders for which hewas remarkable, Irus trembles at the thought of encountering him. But itis too late: with a single blow Ulysses breaks his jaw, and drags himout into the courtyard. The revellers now hail the conqueror with loudapplause, and award him the prize of victory--a goat-paunch filled withmince-meat and blood, the prototype, apparently, both of the Scotchhaggis and the English black-pudding. Amphinomus--who has already shownsomething of a nobler nature than the rest--adds a few words of generoussympathy: he sees in the wandering mendicant one who has known betterdays, and pledges him in a cup of wine, with a hope that brighterfortunes are yet in store. Ulysses is touched with pity for the fatewhich the young man’s evil companions are inevitably drawing on him. Hehad heard, he tells him, of his father, Nisus--had known him, doubtless,in fact--a wise and good man; such ought the son to be. He adds a voiceof ominous warning, tinged with that saddened view of man at his bestestate which continually breaks forth, even amidst the lighter passagesof the poet.   “Earth than a man no poorer feebler thing    Rears, of all creatures that here breathe or move;    Who, while the gods lend health, and his knees string,    Boasts that no sorrow he is born to prove.    But when the gods assail him from above,    Then doth he bear it with a bitter mind,    Dies without help, or liveth against love.”Penelope now descends from her chamber for a moment into the hall, tohave speech with her son. The goddess Minerva has shed on her suchradiant grace and beauty, that her appearance draws forth passionateadmiration from Eurymachus. She does but taunt him in reply: mostsuitors, she says, at least bring presents in their hand; these of hersdo but rob, where others give freely. They are all stung sufficientlyby her words to produce at once from their stores some costlyofferings--embroidered robes, chains and brooches and necklaces of goldand electrum. The queen, after the practical fashion of the age, is nottoo disdainful to carry them off to her chamber; while Ulysses--asindeed seems more in accordance with his character--secretly rejoices tosee his wife thus “spoiling the Egyptians.” Some commentators haveapologised for this seeming meanness on the part of Penelope by theexplanation, that she does it to inspire them with false hopes of herchoosing one of them now at last for her husband, and so lulling theminto a false security in order to insure their easier destruction. Butit is best to take the moral tone of these early poems honestly, as wefind it, and not attempt to force it into too close agreement with ourown.After some further acts of insult, still borne with a wrathful enduranceby Ulysses, the company quit the hall, as usual, for the night. ThenPenelope descends again from her chamber, and sitting by the hearth,bids a chair be set also for the wandering stranger: she will hear histale. He represents himself to her as the brother of King Idomeneus ofCrete, and as having once in his brother’s absence entertained the greatUlysses in his halls. To Penelope’s eager questions, by which she seeksto test his veracity, he answers by describing not so much the person ofher husband as his distinctive dress. The queen recognises, in thisdescription, the curiously-embroidered mantle which she had worked forhim, and the golden clasp, “linked with twin stars,” which she hadfastened with her own hands when he parted from her to go to Troy. Shebreaks into floods of tears at the recollection; while the disguisedUlysses sets his eyes hard, “as though they were of horn or steel,” andchecks his rising tears. He comforts her with the assurance that hebrings recent news of her hero--of his shipwreck and visit to thePhæacians; that he is even now on his way to Ithaca, last heard of inthe neighbouring island of Dulichium, within easy reach of home; nay,this very year, he would be content to pledge himself, Ulysses shallstand once more in his own halls. Incredulous, yet thankful for thecomfort, the queen orders the wanderer to be taken to the bath, andentertained as an honoured guest. But he refuses all attendance savethat of the aged Eurycleia. She marks with wonder his likeness to herabsent master; but such resemblance, he assures her, has been noticedfrequently by others. As she bathes his feet, her eyes fall on awell-remembered scar, left by a wound received from a boar’s tusk in hisyouth while hunting on Mount Parnassus with his grandsireAutolycus.[41] The old nurse doubts no longer. She lets the foot fallheavily, and upsets the bath.   “Surely thou art Ulysses--yes, thou art--    My darling child, and I not knew my king    Till I had handled thee in every part!”He puts his hand upon her throat, and forcibly checks her outcry; hispurpose is not to be known openly as yet, for he feels there are few,even of his own household, whom he can trust. He charges her--even onpain of death, much as he loves her--to keep his secret; then, refusingall softer accommodation, he lies down in the vestibule on a couch ofbullhide, not sleeping, but nursing his wrath in a fever ofwakefulness.CHAPTER IX.THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION.The morrow is a festival of Apollo. It is kept by the riotous crew inthe halls of Ulysses with more than their usual revelry. The disguisedhero himself, feeding at a small table apart by command of Telemachus,is still subject to their insults. But portents are not wanting of theirimpending doom. In the midst of the feast Minerva casts them into fitsof ghastly laughter; the meat which they are eating drips with gore; andthe seer Theoclymenus--a refugee under the protection of Telemachus--whohas been of late their unwilling companion, sees each man’s headenveloped in a misty darkness, and the whole court and vestibulethronged with ghostly shapes. He cries out in affright, and tells themwhat sight he sees; but they only answer him with mockery, and threatento drive him forth as one who has lost his wits. After warning them ofthe fate which he foresees awaiting them, he quits the company. Theyturn upon Telemachus, and taunt him with his sorry choice of guests:first yon lazy disreputable vagabond, and now this prating would-besoothsayer. The young man makes no reply, but watches his fatheranxiously; and Ulysses still bides his time.The queen meanwhile has bethought her of a new device, to put off yetawhile the evil day in which she must at length make her choice amongsther importunate lovers. She unlocks an inner chamber where the treasuresof the house are stored, and draws from its case Ulysses’ bow, the giftof his dead friend Iphitus, which he had not taken with him to Troy.Before she carries it down, she lays it fondly on her knees, and weepsas she thinks of its absent master. One cunning feat she remembers whichher hero was wont to perform--to drive an arrow straight through thehollow rings of twelve axe-heads set up in a line. Whichsoever of hersuitors can bend the strong bow, and send a shaft right through thewhole row of twelve, like the lost Ulysses, that man she will follow,however reluctantly, as her future lord. She has more than a lingeringhope, we may be sure, that one and all will fail in a trial somanifestly difficult. They would refuse the ordeal, but for Antinous.Confident in his own powers, he hopes to succeed--he knows the rest willfail. They, out of shame, accept the test. Telemachus himself fixes theweapons firmly in the earth in a true and even line, a task in itself ofno small difficulty, but which he performs with such skill as to win theadmiration of the whole party. He claims the right to make trial firsthimself, in the hope to prove himself his father’s true son. Thrice hedraws the bow-string, but not yet to its right extent. As he is making afourth attempt, sanguine of success, he meets a look from his fatherwhich checks his hand. Ulysses foresees that should his son succeedwhere the others fail, and so claim what they are really seeking, theroyal power of Ithaca, the whole band might suddenly unite against him,and so frustrate his present scheme of vengeance. Reluctantly, at hisfather’s sign, the youth lays down the bow, and professes to lament theweakness of his degenerate hand. One after another the rival princes inturn strive to bend it, but in vain; even Antinous and Eurymachus,notably the best among them, fail to move the string, though the bow iswarmed by the fire and rubbed well with melted fat to make it morepliable. Antinous finds plausible excuse for the failure--they haveprofaned the festival of Apollo by this contest; it shall be renewedunder better auspices on the morrow. Then the seeming beggar (whomeanwhile has made himself known as their true lord to Eumæus andanother faithful retainer, the herdsman Philœtius) makes request that hemay try his hand upon this wondrous bow. Loud and coarse is the abusewhich Antinous and his fellows shower upon him for his audacity; butTelemachus exerts the authority in his mother’s house which hisuninvited guests seem never quite to make up their minds to dispute whenit is firmly claimed, and the weapon is given into the hands of its trueowner. He handles it gently and lovingly, turning it over and over tosee whether it has in any way suffered by time or decay, and bringsnotes from the tight-strained bow-string, “shrill and sweet as the voiceof the swallow.” At last he fits an arrow to the notch, and, notdeigning even to rise from his seat to make the effort, draws it to itsfull stretch, and sends the shaft right through the whole line ofaxe-heads. It is the immediate prelude to the bloody tragedy whichfollows--                        “‘Behold, the mark is hit,      Hit without labour! the old strength cleaves fast      Upon me, and my bones are stourly knit--    Not as the suitors mock me in their scornful wit.      “‘Now is it time their evening meal to set      Before the Achaians, ere the sun go down.      And other entertainment shall come yet,      Dance and the song, which are the banquet’s crown.’      He spake, and with his eyebrows curved the frown.      Seizing his sword and spear Telemachus came,      Son of Odysseus, chief of high renown,      And, helmeted with brass like fiery flame,    Stood by his father’s throne and waited the dire aim.      “Stript of his rags then leapt the godlike king      On the great threshold, in his hand the bow      And quiver, filled with arrows of mortal sting.      These with a rattle he rained down below,      Loose at his feet, and spake among them so:      ‘See, at the last our matchless bout is o’er!      Now for another mark, that I may know      If I can hit what none hath hit before,    And if Apollo hear me in the prayer I pour!’”The philosopher Plato, who did not spare the poet occasionally, in hiscriticisms, speaks of this passage as worthy of all admiration. We havehere the primitive type, since worked out into countless shapes, of the“situations” and “discoveries” which abound in modern romance and drama.Ulysses aims the first arrow at Antinous. It pierces him in the throatas he is raising a goblet to his lips, and he falls backward in theagonies of death, spilling the untasted wine upon the floor; thus givingoccasion (so says Greek tradition) to that which has now become a commonEnglish proverb--“There’s many a slip ’twixt the cup and the lip.”[42]His comrades stand aghast for a moment, not certain whether the shot bedeliberate or merely accidental. Ulysses sets them at rest on that pointby declaring himself and his purpose. They look round the hall for thearms which usually hang upon the walls, but these have been secretlyremoved during the previous night by Ulysses and his son. Eurymachus,who has more plausible rhetoric at his command than the others, nowendeavours to make terms. Antinous, he confesses, has well deserved hisfate--he had plotted against the life of Telemachus; but for himself andthe rest, now that the king has come to his own again, they will submitthemselves, and pay such fine as shall amply satisfy him for thedespoiling of his goods. Ulysses scornfully rejects all such compromise.Then, at Eurymachus’ call, the boldest of the party draw their knivesand make a rush upon him. But a second arrow from the terrible bowstrikes Eurymachus through the breast before he reaches him; Amphinomusfalls by the spear of Telemachus as soon as he gets within range; andwhile the father, backed by his two retainers, holds the rest atbay--rather, we must suppose, by the terror of his presence than theactual use of his bow--the son rushes off to find arms for the littleparty. Ulysses plies his arrows till they are exhausted, and then thefour together continue the unequal combat with the spears now broughtby Telemachus. The details of the work of retribution, like some of thelong slaughter-lists in the Iliad, sufficiently interesting to anaudience for whom war was the great game of human life, are scarcely soto modern and more fastidious readers. The hero, like all heroes ofromance, performs deeds which in a mere prosaic view would appearimpossibilities. Suffice it to say, that with the Goddess of Wisdom asan ally (who appears once more under the form of Mentor), the combatends in the slaughter of the whole band of intruders, even though theyare partially supplied with arms by the treacherous goatherd, who bringsthem from the armoury which Telemachus has carelessly left open. A grazeupon the wrist of Telemachus, and a slight flesh-wound where the spearof one of the enemy “wrote on the shoulder” of the good swineherdEumæus, are the only hurts received by their party in the combat. Thevengeance of the hero is implacable; otherwise it were not heroic, inthe Homeric sense. Not content with the utter extermination of the menwho have usurped his palace, harassed his wife, and insulted his son, hehangs up also their guilty paramours among the women-servants, who havejoined them in defiling his household gods; first, however, making themswill and scour clean the blood-stained hall which has been the scene ofthe slaughter. The traitorous goatherd Melanthius is by the same sternorders miserably lopped of ears, and nose, and limbs, before deathreleases him. We find the same pitiless cruelty towards his enemies inthe hero of the Odyssey as in the hero of the Iliad. Yet the poet wouldteach us that the vengeance of Ulysses is but the instrument of thedivine justice. Like Moses or Joshua, he is but the passionless executorof the wrath of heaven; while, still to continue the parallel, themerciless character of the retribution takes its colour from theferocity of the age. When the aged Eurycleia, who as yet alone of thewomen of the household knows the secret of his return, comes down andsees the floor strewn with the bloody corpses, she is about to raise ashout of triumph. But the king checks her:--   “Nurse, with a mute heart this my vengeance hail!    Not holy is it o’er the slain to boast.    These Heaven and their own crimes have brought to bale;    Since of all strangers, from earth’s every coast,    No man was honoured of this godless host,    Nor good nor evil, whosoe’er they knew--    And with their souls they pay the fatal cost.”CHAPTER X.THE RECOGNITION BY PENELOPE.Penelope, far off in her chamber, has not heard the tumult, for thedoors between the men’s and women’s apartments had been carefully lockedby Eumæus, by his lord’s order. Even when the nurse rushes up to herwith the tidings that Ulysses himself has returned, and made thisterrible lustration of his household, she yet remains incredulous. Theriotous crew may have met their deserved fate, but the hand that hasslain them must be that of some deity, not of Ulysses. Yet she will godown and look upon the corpses. There, leaning “by a pillar” in theroyal place--like King Joash at his coronation, or King Josiah when hesware to the covenant--she beholds Ulysses. But he is still in hisbeggar’s weed, and after twenty years of absence she is slow torecognise him. Both Eurycleia and Telemachus break into anger at herincredulity. The king himself is outwardly as little moved as ever. Hewill give tokens of his identity hereafter. For the present there areprecautions to be taken. The slaughter of so many nobles of Ithaca willscarce be taken lightly when it is heard in the island; it must not beknown abroad until he can try the temper of his subjects, and gather aloyal host around him. All traces of the bloody scene which has justbeen enacted must be carefully concealed; the house must ring with harp,and song, and dance, that all who hear may think the queen has made herchoice at last, and is holding her wedding-feast to-day--as, in truth,in a better sense she shall. Ulysses himself goes to the bath to washaway the stains of slaughter. Thence he comes forth endued once more byhis guardian goddess with the “hyacinthine” locks and the grand presencewhich he had worn in the court of Phæacia. He appeals now to his wife’smemory, for she yet gives no sure sign of recognition:--   “Lady, the gods that in Olympus dwell    Have, beyond mortal women, given to thee    Heart as of flint, which none can soften well.    Lives not a wife who could endure, save thee,    Her lord to slight, who, roaming earth and sea,    Comes to his own land in the twentieth year.    Haste, Eurycleia, and go spread for me    Some couch, that I may sleep--but not with her.”Penelope does recognise the form and features--it is indeed, to alloutward appearance, the Ulysses from whom she parted in tears twentyyears ago. But such appearances are deceitful; gods have been known, erenow, to put on the form of men to gain the love of mortals. She will puthim to one certain test she wots of. “Give him his own bed,” she says tothe nurse; “go, bring it forth from what was our bridal chamber.” Butthe couch of which she speaks is, as she and he both well know,immovable. Its peculiar structure, as detailed in Homer’s verse, is byno means easy to unravel. But it is formed in some cunning fashion outof the stem of an olive-tree, rooted and growing, round which the herohimself had built a bridal chamber. Move it?--“There lives no mortal,”exclaims Ulysses, “who could stir it from its place.” Then, at last, allPenelope’s long doubts are solved in happy certainty:--     “Then from her eyelids the quick tears did start,      And she ran to him from her place, and threw      Her arms about his neck, and a warm dew      Of kisses poured upon him, and thus spake:      ‘Frown not, Odysseus; thou art wise and true!      But God gave sorrow, and hath grudged to make    Our path to old age sweet, nor willed us to partake     “‘Youth’s joys together. Yet forgive me this,      Nor hate me that when first I saw thy brow      I fell not on thy neck, and gave no kiss,      Nor wept in thy dear arms as I weep now.      For in my breast a bitter fear did bow      My soul, and I lived shuddering day by day,      Lest a strange man come hither, and avow      False things, and steal my spirit, and bewray    My love; such guile men scheme, to lead the pure astray.           *       *       *       *       *     “‘But now, since clearly thou unfoldest this,      The secret of our couch, which none hath read,      Save only thee and me and Actoris,      Whom my sire gave me, when I first was wed,      To guard the chamber of our bridal bed--       Now I believe against my own belief.’      She ending a desire of weeping bred      Within him, and in tears the noble chief    Clasped his true wife, exulting in their glorious grief.     “Sweet as to swimmers the dry land appears,      Whose bark Poseidon in the angry sea      Strikes with a tempest, and in pieces tears,      And a few swimmers from the white deep flee,      Crested with salt foam, and with tremulous knee      Spring to the shore exulting; even so      Sweet was her husband to Penelope,      Nor from his neck could she at all let go    Her white arms, nor forbid her thickening tears to flow.”When they retire to rest, each has a long tale to tell. The personaladventures of Ulysses alone (however careful he might have been toabridge them in some particulars for his present auditor) would havemade up many an Arabian Night’s entertainment. There would surely havebeen little time left for Penelope’s story, but that Minerva’s agencylengthens the ordinary night--   “Nor from the rolling river of Ocean’s stream    Suffered the golden-thronèd Dawn to beam,    Or yoke the horses that bear light to men.”Here, according to our modern notions of completeness, the Odysseyshould surely end. Accordingly some critics have surmised that thetwenty-fourth and last book is not Homer’s, but a later addition. But wemay very well suppose that the primitive taste for narrative in thepoet’s day was more simple and childlike; that an ancient Greek audiencewould inquire, as our own children would, into all the details of thesequel, and not be satisfied even with the comprehensive assertion that“they lived happy ever afterwards.” We have therefore, in the text as ithas come down to us, a kind of supplement to the tale, which, as is thecase with the later scenes in some of Shakespeare’s tragedies, ratherweakens the force of the real catastrophe. An episode at the beginningof this last book shows us again the regions of the dead, to which thegod Mercury is conducting the spirits of the dead suitors--pale ghostswho follow him, gibbering and cowering with fear, into that “sunlessland.” The main purpose of the poet seems to be the opportunity oncemore of introducing the shades of the great heroes, Achilles andAgamemnon; the latter contrasting his own miserable and dishonoured endwith that of Achilles, blest above all mortals, dying in battle with allthe flower of Ilium and Greece around him, and leaving a name which is asound of glory over the whole earth. So also does he contrast, toPenelope’s honour, her fidelity with the treachery of his own queenClytemnestra; giving voice to a prophecy which has been fulfilled almostbeyond even a poet’s aspirations:--   “O to her first one love how true was she!    Nought shall make dim the flower of her sweet fame    For ever, but the gods unceasingly    Shall to the earth’s inhabitants her name,    Wide on the wings of song, with endless praise proclaim.”Ulysses himself has yet to visit and make himself known to his agedfather Laertes, who is still alive, but living in sad retirement on hisisland-farm, solacing himself as well as he may with pruning and tendinghis orchard-grounds. The recognition scene, in which the scar left bythe boar’s tusk is once more the touchstone, will seem tedious, assavouring too much of repetition, to most readers of our day. But thereis one point which has a special and simple beauty of its own. WhenLaertes seems yet incredulous as to his son’s identity, Ulysses remindshim how, when he was yet a child, following his father about theorchards, and begging with a child’s pertinacity, he had given him “forhis very own” a certain number of apple, fig, and pear trees andvines--all which he can still remember and enumerate. The token isirresistible, and the old man all but faints for joy.An attempt at rebellion on the part of some of his Ithacan subjects, whoare enraged at his slaughter of their nobles, and which is headed by thefather of the dead Antinous, fails to revive the fading interest of thetale. The ringleader falls by a spear cast by the trembling hand ofLaertes, and the malcontents submit, after a brief contest, to theirlawful chief.A hint of future travel for the hero leaves his history in some degreestill incomplete. A penance had been imposed upon him by the seerTiresias, by which alone he could appease Neptune for the cruel injuryinflicted on his son, the giant Polyphemus. He must seek out some peoplewho had never seen the sea, and never eaten salt, and there offersacrifice to the god. Then, and only then, he might hope to reign forthe rest of his life in peace amongst his islanders. Of the fulfilmentof this pilgrimage the poet tells us nothing. Other legends representUlysses as meeting his death at last from the hand of his own sonTelegonus (born of his amour with Circe), who had landed in the islandof Ithaca on a piratical enterprise. We may remark the coincidence--orthe imitation--in the later legend of the British Arthur, who is slainin battle by his illegitimate son Mordred. The veil which even traditionleaves hanging over the great wanderer’s fate is no inappropriateconclusion to his story. A life of inaction, even in his old age, seemshardly suited to the poetical conception of this hero of unrest. In thefragmentary legends of the Middle Ages there is almost material for asecond Odyssey. There, the Greek voyager becomes the pioneer of Atlanticdiscoverers--sailing still on into the unknown West in search of theEarthly Paradise, founding new cities as he goes, and at last meetinghis death in Atlantic waters. The Italian poets--Tasso, Pulci, andespecially Dante--adopted the tradition. In the ‘Inferno’ of the latter,the spirit of Ulysses thus discloses the last scenes of his career:--   “Nor fondness for my son, nor reverence    Of my old father, nor return of love,    That should have crowned Penelope with joy,    Could overcome in me the zeal I had    To explore the world, and search the ways of life,    Man’s evil and his virtue. Forth I sailed    Into the deep illimitable main,    With but one bark, and the small faithful band    That yet cleaved to me. As Iberia far,    Far as Marocco, either shore I saw,    And the Sardinian and each isle beside    Which round that ocean bathes. Tardy with age    Were I and my companions, when we came    To the strait pass, where Hercules ordained    The boundaries not to be o’erstepped by man.[43]    The walls of Seville to my right I left,    On the other hand already Ceuta past.    ‘O brothers!’ I began, ‘who to the west    Through perils without number now have reached;    To this the short remaining watch, that yet    Our senses have to wake, refuse not proof    Of the unpeopled world, following the track    Of Phœbus. Call to mind from whence ye sprang:    Ye were not formed to live the life of brutes,    But virtue to pursue and knowledge high.’    With these few words I sharpened for the voyage    The mind of my associates, that I then    Could scarcely have withheld them. To the dawn    Our poop we turned, and for the witless flight    Made our oars wings,[44] still gaining on the left.    Each star of the other pole night now beheld,    And ours so low, that from the ocean floor    It rose not. Five times re-illumed, as oft    Vanished the light from underneath the moon,    Since the deep way we entered, when from far    Appeared a mountain dim, loftiest methought    Of all I e’er beheld. Joy seized us straight;    But soon to mourning changed. From the new land    A whirlwind sprung, and at her foremost side    Did strike the vessel. Thrice it whirled her round    With all the waves; the fourth time lifted up    The poop, and sank the prow: so fate decreed:    And over us the booming billow closed.”            --Inferno, xxvi. (Cary’s transl.)Thus also Mr Tennyson--drawing from Dante not less happily than he sooften does from Homer--makes his Ulysses resign the idle sceptre intothe hands of the home-keeping Telemachus, and tempt the seas once morein quest of new adventures:--    “There lies the port: the vessel puffs her sail:     There gloom the dark broad seas. My mariners,     Souls that have toiled, and wrought, and thought with me,     That ever with a frolic welcome took     The thunder and the sunshine, and opposed     Free hearts, free foreheads--you and I are old:     Old age hath yet his honour and his toil;     Death closes all, but something ere the end,     Some work of noble note, may yet be done.            *       *       *       *       *     ’Tis not too late to seek a newer world.     Push off, and sitting well in order smite     The sounding furrows: for my purpose holds     To sail beyond the sunset and the baths     Of all the western stars, until I die.     It may be that the gulfs will wash us down:     It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,     And see the great Achilles, whom we knew.”CHAPTER XI.CONCLUDING REMARKS.The resemblance which these Homeric poems bear, in many remarkablefeatures, to the romances of mediæval chivalry, has been long agoremarked, and has already been incidentally noticed in these pages. Thepeculiar caste of kings and chiefs--or kings and knights, as they arecalled in the Arthurian and Carlovingian tales--before whom theunfortunate “churls” tremble and fly like sheep, is a feature common toboth. “Then were they afraid when they saw a knight”--is the pregnantsentence which, in Mallory’s ‘King Arthur,’ reveals a whole volume ofsocial history; for the knight, in the particular instance, was butriding quietly along, and there ought to have been no reason why the“churls” should dread the sight of a professed redresser of grievances.But even so Ulysses condescends to use no argument to this class but theactive use of his staff; and Achilles dreads above all things dying “thedeath of a churl” drowned in a brook. It is only the noble, the priest,and the divine bard who emerge into the light of romance. The lives andfeelings of the mere toilers for bread are held unworthy of theminstrel’s celebration. Just as in the early romances of Christendom wedo not get much lower in the social scale than the knight and the lady,the bishop and the wizard, so in these Homeric lays--even in the moredomestic Odyssey, unless we make Eumæus the exception--the tale stillclings to the atmosphere of courts and palaces, and ignores almostentirely, unless for the purpose of drawing out a simile orillustration, the life-drama of the great mass of human kind. In boththese cycles of fiction we find represented a state of things--whetherwe call it the “heroic age” or the “age of chivalry”--which could hardlyhave existed in actual life; and in both the phase of civilisation, andthe magnificence of the properties and the scenery, seem far beyond whatthe narrators could have themselves seen and known.The character of the hero must not be judged by modern canons ofmorality. With all the honest purpose and steadfast heart which wewillingly concede to him, we cannot but feel there is a shiftiness inhis proceedings from first to last which scarcely savours of trueheroism. We need not call him, as Thersites does in Shakespeare, “thatdog-fox Ulysses,” nor even go quite so far as to look upon him as what amodern translator terms him, “the Scapin of epic poetry;” but we see inhim the embodiment of prudence, versatility, and expediency, rather thanof the nobler and less selfish virtues. Ulysses, both in the Iliad andin the Odyssey, is the diplomatist of his age; and it is neither hisfault nor Homer’s that the diplomacy of that date was less refined, andless skilful in veiling its coarser features. Even in much later times,dissimulation has been held an indispensable quality in rulers;[45] andan English philosopher tells us plainly that “the intriguing spirit, theoverreaching manner, and the over-refinement of art and policy, arenaturally incident to the experienced and thorough politician.”[46] Atthe same time, it must be remembered that Ulysses employs deceit onlywhere it was recognised and allowed by the moral code of theage--against his enemies; he is never for a moment otherwise than trueto his friends. Nay, while the kings and leaders in the Iliad are toofairly open to the reproach of holding cheap the lives and the interestsof the meaner multitude who followed them, Ulysses is, throughout hislong wanderings, the sole protecting providence, so far as theirwilfulness will allow him, of his followers as well as of himself.The tale of his wanderings has been a rich mine of wealth for poets andromancers, painters and sculptors, from the dim date of the age which wecall Homer’s down to our own. In this wonderful poem, be its authorshipwhat it may, lie the germs of thousands of the volumes which fill ourmodern libraries. Not that all their authors are either wilfulplagiarists or even conscious imitators; but because the Greek poet,first of all whose thoughts have been preserved to us in writing,touched, in their deepest as well as their lightest tones, those chordsof human action and passion which find an echo in all hearts and in allages.First, that is to say, of all whose utterances we regard as merelyhuman. There are, indeed, other recorded utterances to which the song ofHomer, unlike as it is, has yet wonderful points of resemblance. For thestudent of Scripture, the prince of heathen poets possesses a specialinterest. It is quite unnecessary to insist upon the actual connectionwhich some enthusiastic champions of sacred literature have eithertraced or fancied between the lays of the Greek bard and the inspiredrecords of the chosen people. Whether the Hebrew chronicles, in anyform, could have reached the eye or ear of the poet in his manywanderings is, to say the least, extremely doubtful. But Homer bears anindependent witness to the truth and accuracy of the sacred narrative,so far as its imagery and diction are to be taken into account, which isvery remarkable and valuable. Allowing for the difference in the localscenery, the reader of the Iliad may well fancy at times that he isfollowing the night-march of Abraham, the conquests of Joshua, or thewars of the Kings; while in the Odyssey the same domestic interiors, thesame primitive family life, the same simple patriarchal relationsbetween the king or chief of the tribe and his people, remind us inevery page of the fresh and living pictures of the book of Genesis.Fresh and living the portraits still are, in both cases, after the lapseof so many centuries, because in both the writers drew faithfully fromwhat was before their eyes, without any straining after effect--withoutany betrayal of that self-consciousness which spoils many an author’sbest work, by forcing his own individuality upon the reader instead ofthat of the scenes and persons whom he represents. To trace the manypoints of resemblance between these two great poems and the sacredrecords as fully as they might be traced would require a volume initself. It may be enough in these pages shortly to point out some few ofthe many instances in which Homer will be found one of the mostinteresting, because assuredly one of the most unconscious, commentatorson the Bible. Many hours and days, and decades later, Kyle responded to Justin's question to Gato with "I am good!". The Homeric kings, like those of Israel and Judah, lead the battle intheir chariots: Priam sits “in the gate,” like David or Solomon:Ulysses, when he would assert his royalty, stands by a pillar, as stoodJoash and Josiah. Their riches consist chiefly in “sheep and oxen,men-servants and maid-servants.” When Ulysses, in the Iliad, findsDiomed sleeping outside his tent,--“and his comrades lay sleeping aroundhim, and under their heads they had their shields, and their spears werefixed in the ground by the butt-end”[47]--we have the picture, almostword for word, of Saul’s night-bivouac when he was surprised by David:“And behold, Saul lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck inthe ground at his bolster, and the people lay round about him.” Ulyssesand Diomed think it not beneath their dignity, as kings or chiefs, toact what we should consider the part of a spy, like Gideon in the campof the Midianites. Lycurgus the Thracian slays with an ox-goad, likeShamgar in the Book of Judges. The very cruelties of warfare are thesame--the insults too frequently offered to the dead body of an enemy,“the children dashed against the stones”--the miserable sight whichPriam foresees in the fall of his city, as Isaiah in the propheticburden of Babylon.[48]The outward tokens of grief are wholly Eastern. Achilles, in the Iliad,when he hears of the death of his friend Patroclus--Laertes, in theOdyssey, when he believes his son’s return hopeless--throw dust upontheir heads, like Joshua and the elders of Israel when they hear of thedisaster at Ai. King Priam tears his hair and beard in his vain appealto Hector at the Scæan gates, as Ezra does, when he hears of thetrespasses of the Jewish princes.[49] Penelope sits “on the threshold”to weep, just as Moses “heard the people weeping, every man in the doorof his tent.” “Call for the mourning women,” says the prophetJeremiah,[50] “that they may come; and let them make haste, and take upa wailing for us.” So when the Trojan king bears off his dead son atlast to his own palace, the professional mourners are immediately sentfor--“the bards, to begin the lament.”[51] As Moses carries forth thebones of Joseph into Canaan, and David gathers carefully those of Sauland Jonathan from the men of Jabesh-Gilead, so Nestor charges theGreeks, when they have almost determined to quit Troy in despair, tocarry the bones of their slain comrades home to their native land.Sarpedon’s body is borne to his native Lycia, there to be honoured “witha mound and with a column”--as Jacob set up a pillar for his deadRachel on the road by Bethlehem. The Philistines, after the battle ofGilboa, bestow the armour of Saul in the house of their goddessAshtaroth: the sword of Goliath is laid up as a trophy with the priestAhimelech, “wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod;”[52] even so doesHector vow to hang up the armour of Menelaus in the temple of Apollo inTroy.The more peaceful images have the same remarkable likeness. The fountainin the island of Ithaca, faced with stone, the work of the forefathersof the nation, Ithacus and Neritus, recalls that “well of theoath”--Beer-sheba--which Abraham dug, or that by which the woman ofSamaria sat, known as “the well of our father Jacob.” The stone whichthe goddess Minerva upheaves to hurl against Mars, which “men of old hadset to be a boundary of the land”--the two white stones,[53] of unknowndate and history even in the poet’s own day, of which he doubts whetherthey be sepulchral or boundary, which Achilles made the turning-pointfor the chariot-race,--these cannot fail to remind us of the stonesBohan and Ebenezer, and of the warning in the Proverbs--“Remove not theancient landmark, which thy fathers have set up.” The women grinding atthe mill, the oxen treading out the corn, the measure by cubit, thechanges of raiment, the reverence due to the stranger and to thepoor,--the dowry given by the bridegroom, as by way of purchase, notreceived with the bride,--all these are as familiar to us in the booksof Moses as in the poems of Homer. The very figures of speech are thesame. The passionate apostrophe of Moses and Isaiah--“Hear, O heavens,and give ear, O earth”--is used by Juno in the Iliad, and by Calypso inthe Odyssey.[54] “Day” is commonly employed as an equivalent for fate orjudgment; “the half of one’s kingdom” is held to be a right royal gift;“the gates of hell” are the culmination of evil. Telemachus swears “bythe woes of his father,” as Jacob does “by the fear of his fatherIsaac;” and the curse pronounced on Phœnix by his father--“that nevergrandchild of his begetting might sit upon his knees”[55]--recalls thesacred text in which we are told that “the children of Machir, the sonof Manasseh, were brought up on Joseph’s knees.”Many and various have been the theories of interpretation which havebeen employed, by more or less ingenious writers, to develop what theyhave considered the inner meaning of the poet’s tale. Such speculationsbegan at a very early date in literary history. They were current amongGreek philosophers in the days of Socrates, but he himself would notadmit them. It is impossible, and would be wearisome even if it werepossible, to discuss them all. But one especially must be mentioned, notwholly modern, but which has won much favour of late in the world ofscholars,--that in both poems we have certain truths of physical andastronomical science represented under an allegorical form, importedinto Greek fable from Eastern sources. This theory is, to say the least,so interesting and ingenious, that without presuming here to discussits truth, it claims a brief mention. It may be fairest to put it in thewords of one of its most enthusiastic advocates. So far as it applies tothe Odyssey, it stands thus:--“The Sun [Ulysses] leaves his bride the Twilight [Penelope] in the sky,where he sinks beneath the sea, to journey in silence and darkness tothe scene of the great fight with the powers of Darkness [the Siege ofTroy]. The ten weary years of the war are the weary hours of thenight.... The victory is won: but the Sun still longs to see again thebeautiful bride from whom he parted yester-eve. Dangers may await him,but they cannot arrest his steps: things lovely may lavish their beautyupon him, but they cannot make him forget her.... But he cannot reachhis home until another series of ten long years have come to an end--theSun cannot see the Twilight until another day is done.”[56]So, in the Iliad, as has been already noticed, Paris and the Trojansrepresent the powers of Darkness, “who steal away the beautiful Twilight[Helen] from the western sky;” while Achilles is the Sun, who puts torout these forces of the Night.[57]In contrast, though not necessarily in contradiction, to this physicalallegory, stands the moral interpretation, a favourite one with some ofthe mediæval students of Homer, which sees in the Odyssey nothing lessthan the pilgrimage of human life--beset with dangers and seductions onevery side, yet blessed with divine guidance, and reaching its goal atlast, through suffering and not without loss. Every point in thewanderings of the hero has been thus made to teach its parable, more orless successfully. The different adventures have each had their specialapplication: Circe represents the especially sensual appetites; theLotus-eating is indolence; the Sirens the temptations of the ear; theforbidden oxen of the Sun the “flesh-pots of Egypt”--the sin ofgluttony. It is at least well worthy of remark how, throughout the wholenarrative, the false rest is brought into contrast with the true. Not inthe placid indolence of the Lotus-eaters, not in the luxurious halls ofCirce or in the grotto of Calypso, nor even in the joyous society of thePhæacians, but only in the far-off home, the seat of the higher andbetter affections, is the pilgrim’s real resting-place. The key-note ofthis didactic interpretation, which has an undoubted beauty and pathosof its own, making the old Greek poet, like the Mosaic law, aschoolmaster to Christian doctrine, has been well touched by a modernwriter:--   “O beautiful and strange epitome    Of this our life, while through the tale we trace    Homeless Ulysses on the land and sea!    From childhood to old age it is the face    Of heaven-lost, yearning man: from place to place    Whether he wander forth abroad, or knows    No change but of home-nature and of grace,    Still is he as one seeking for repose--    A man of many thoughts, a man of many woes.”[58]Some of the early religious commentators pushed such interpretations toextravagance; they dealt with Homer as the extreme patristic school oftheology dealt with the Old Testament: they so busied themselves inseeking for mystical interpretations in every verse, that they held theplain and literal meaning of the text as of almost secondary importance.It was said of one French scholar--D’Aurat--a man of some learning, thathe spent his life in trying to find all the Bible in Homer. Such men sawParadise disguised in the gardens of Alcinous; the temptation of thechaste Bellerophon was but a pagan version of the story of Joseph; thefall of Troy evidently prefigured, to their fancy, the destruction ofJerusalem. Some went even further, and turned this tempting weapon ofallegory against their religious opponents: thus Doctor Jacobus Hugo sawthe Lutheran heretics prefigured in the Lotus-eaters of the Odyssey, andthought that the reckless Antinous was a type of Martin Luther himself.Those who are content to take Homer as he is, the poet of all ages,without seeking to set him up either as a prophet or as a moralphilosopher, may take comfort from, the brief criticism of Lord Baconupon all over-curious interpretation--“I do rather think the fable wasfirst, and the exposition devised after.” The most ingenious theories asto the hidden meaning of the song are at best but the mists which theHomerists have thrown round their deity--    “The moony vapour rolling round the king.”He moves among them all, a dim mysterious figure, but hardly less thandivine.END OF THE ODYSSEY.PRINTED BY WILLIAM BLACKWOOD AND SONS, EDINBURGH.       *       *       *       *       *EDUCATIONAL WORKSPUBLISHED BYWILLIAM BLACKWOOD & SONS,EDINBURGH AND LONDON._English Language._AN ETYMOLOGICAL AND PRONOUNCING DICTIONARY OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE.Including a very copious selection of Scientific, Technical, and otherTerms and Phrases.

Murchison).--We must admire the ability and perseveringresearch with which he has succeeded in imparting to his ‘Manual’ somuch freshness and originality. In no respect is this character moreapparent than in the plan of arrangement, by which the author commenceshis description of the physical geography of each tract by a sketch ofits true basis or geological structure. The work is largely sold inScotland, but has not been sufficiently spoken of in England. It is,indeed, a most useful school-book in opening out geographical knowledge.Saturday Review.--It contains a prodigious array of geographical facts,and will be found useful for reference.English Journal of Education.--Of all the Manuals on Geography that havecome under our notice, we place the one whose title is given above inthe first rank. For fulness of information, for knowledge of method inarrangement, for the manner in which the details are handled, we know ofno work that can, in these respects, compete with Mr Mackay’s Manual.ELEMENTS.A. KEITH JOHNSTON, LL.D., F.R.S.E., F.R.G.S., H.M. Geographer forScotland, Author of the ‘Physical Atlas,’ &c. &c.--There is no work ofthe kind in this or any other language, known to me, which comes so nearmy _ideal_ of perfection in a school-book, on the important subject ofwhich it treats. In arrangement, style, selection of matter, clearness,and thorough accuracy of statement, it is without a rival; and knowing,as I do, the vast amount of labour and research you bestowed on itsproduction, I trust it will be so appreciated as to insure, by anextensive sale, a well-merited reward.G. BICKERTON, Esq., Edinburgh Institution.--I have been led to form avery high opinion of Mackay’s ‘Manual of Geography’ and ‘Elements ofGeography,’ partly from a careful examination of them, and partly frommy experience of the latter as a text-book in the EDINBURGH INSTITUTION.One of their most valuable features is the elaborate Table ofRiver-Basins and Towns, which is given in addition to the ordinaryProvince or County list, so that a good idea may be obtained by thepupil of the natural as well as the political relationship of the townsin each country. On all matters connected with Physical Geography,Ethnography, Government, &c., the information is full, accurate, andwell digested. They are books that can be strongly recommended to thestudent of geography.RICHARD D. GRAHAM, English Master, College for Daughters of Ministers ofthe Church of Scotland and of Professors in the ScottishUniversities.--No work with which I am acquainted so amply fulfils theconditions of a perfect text-book on the important subject of which ittreats, as Dr Mackay’s ‘Elements of Modern Geography.’ In fulness andaccuracy of details, in the scientific grouping of facts, combined withclearness and simplicity of statement, it stands alone, and leavesalmost nothing to be desired in the way of improvement. Eminentlyfitted, by reason of this exceptional variety and thoroughness, to meetall the requirements of higher education, it is never without a livinginterest, which adapts it to the intelligence of ordinary pupils. It isnot the least of its merits that its information is abreast of all thelatest developments in geographical science, accurately exhibiting boththe recent political and territorial changes in Europe, and the manyimportant results of modern travel and research.Spectator.--The best Geography we have ever met with.       *       *       *       *       *_Geology._“_Few of our handbooks of popular science can be said to have greater ormore decisive merit than those of Mr Page on Geology and Palæontology.They are clear and vigorous in style, they never oppress the reader witha pedantic display of learning, nor overwhelm him with a pompous andsuperfluous terminology; and they have the happy art of taking himstraightway to the face of nature herself, instead of leading him by thetortuous and bewildering paths of technical system and artificialclassification._”--Saturday Review.INTRODUCTORY TEXT-BOOK OF GEOLOGY.

The aim has been to make the book strictly whatits name implies, a HANDY ATLAS--a valuable substitute for the ‘Royal,’where that is too bulky or too expensive to find a place, a needfulauxiliary to the junior branches of families, and a _vade mecum_ to thetutor and the pupil-teacher.       *       *       *       *       *_Keith Johnston’s Atlases.__EXTRACTS FROM OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._SCHOOL ATLASES.“They are as superior to all School Atlases within our knowledge, aswere the larger works of the same Author in advance of those thatpreceded them.”--_Educational Times._“Decidedly the best School Atlases we have ever seen.”--_English Journalof Education._“ ... The ‘Physical Atlas’ seems to us particularly well executed....The last generation had no such help to learning as is afforded in theseexcellent elementary Maps. The ‘Classical Atlas’ is a great improvementon what has usually gone by that name; not only is it fuller, but insome cases it gives the same country more than once in different periodsof time. Thus it approaches the special value of a historical atlas. The‘General Atlas’ is wonderfully full and accurate for its scale....Finally, the ‘Astronomical Atlas,’ in which Mr Hind is responsible forthe scientific accuracy of the maps, supplies an admitted educationalwant. No better companion to an elementary astronomical treatise couldbe found than this cheap and convenient collection of maps.”--_SaturdayReview._“The plan of these Atlases is admirable, and the excellence of the planis rivalled by the beauty of the execution.... The best security for theaccuracy and substantial value of a School Atlas is to have it from thehands of a man like our Author, who has perfected his skill by theexecution of much larger works, and gained a character which he will becareful not to jeopardise by attaching his name to anything that iscrude, slovenly, or superficial.”--_Scotsman._“This Edition of the ‘Classical Atlas’ is so much enlarged and improvedas to be virtually a new work, surpassing everything else of the kindextant, both in utility and beauty.”--_Athenæum._THE HANDY ROYAL ATLAS.“Is probably the best work of the kind now published.”--_Times._“Not only are the present territorial adjustments duly registered in allthese Maps, but the latest discoveries in Central Asia, in Africa, andAmerica, have been delineated with laborious fidelity. Indeed the ampleillustration of recent discovery, and of the great groups ofdependencies on the British Crown, renders Dr Johnston’s the best of allAtlases for English use.”--_Pall Mall Gazette._“This is Mr Keith Johnston’s admirable Royal Atlas diminished in bulkand scale so as to be, perhaps, fairly entitled to the name of ‘Handy,’but still not so much diminished but what it constitutes an accurate anduseful general Atlas for ordinary households.”--_Spectator._“The ‘Handy Atlas’ is thoroughly deserving of its name.

JAMES STORMONTH,AND THEREV. P. H. PHELP, M.A._OPINIONS OF THE PRESS._“This will be found a most admirable and useful Dictionary by thestudent, the man of business, or the general inquirer. Its design is tosupply a full and complete pronouncing etymological, and explanatoryDictionary of the English language; and, as far as we can judge, in thatdesign it most completely succeeds. It contains an unusual number ofscientific names and terms, English phrases, and familiarcolloquialisms; this will considerably enhance its value to the generalsearcher after information. The author seems to us to have planned theDictionary exceedingly well. The Dictionary words are printed in boldblack type, and in single letters, that being the form in which wordsare usually presented to the reader. Capital letters begin such wordsonly in proper names, and others which are always so printed. They aregrouped under a leading word, from which they may be presumed naturallyto fall or be formed, or singly follow in alphabetical order--only so,however, when they are derived from the same leading root, and when thealphabetical order may not be materially disturbed. The roots areenclosed within brackets, and for them the works of the best and mostrecent authorities seem to have been consulted. The meanings are thoseusually given, but they have been simplified as much as possible.Nothing unnecessary is given; but, in the way of definition, there willbe found a vast quantity of new matter. The phonetic spelling of thewords has been carefully revised by a Cambridge graduate--Mr Phelp; andDr Page, the well-known geologist, has attended to the correctness ofthe various scientific terms in the book. The Dictionary altogether isvery complete.”--_Greenock Advertiser._“This Dictionary is admirable. The etymological part especially is goodand sound. We have turned to ‘calamity,’ ‘forest,’ ‘poltroon,’ and anumber of other crucial words, and find them all derived according tothe newest lights. There is nothing about ‘calamus,’ and ‘foris,’ and‘pollice truncus,’ such as we used in the etymological dictionaries ofthe old type. The work deserves a place in every English School, whetherboys’ or girls’.”--_Westminster Review._“That which is now before us is evidently a work on which enormous painshave been bestowed. The compilation and arrangement give evidence oflaborious research and very extensive scholarship. Special care seems tohave been bestowed on the pronunciation and etymological derivation, andthe ‘root-words’ which are given are most valuable in helping to aknowledge of primary significations. All through the book are evidencesof elaborate and conscientious work, and any one who masters the variedcontents of this Dictionary will not be far off the attainment of thecomplete art of ‘writing the English language with propriety,’ in thematter of orthography at any rate.”--_Belfast Northern Whig._“This strikes us as likely to prove a useful and valuable work.... Thenumber of scientific terms given is far beyond what we have noticed inprevious works of this kind, and will in great measure render otherspecial dictionaries superfluous. Great care seems also to have beenexercised in giving the correct etymology and pronunciation of words. Wetrust the work may meet with the success it deserves.”--_Graphic._“On the whole, we may characterise Mr Stormonth’s as a really good andvaluable Dictionary; and with the typical exceptions we have pointedout, we frankly allow his claim to have laboured earnestly andconscientiously in the production of it.”--_Journal of Education._“I have examined Stormonth’s Dictionary minutely, and again and againwith satisfaction on points where other Dictionaries left me hopeless.It is an elaborate and splendid work, and with its great fulness, itsgrouping of words, and its meanings of phrases, should be the _vademecum_ of every student. It is a book I would like very much to see inthe hands of all my advanced pupils.”--_David Campbell, Esq., TheAcademy, Montrose._“I am happy to be able to express--and that in the strongest terms ofcommendation--my opinion of the merits of this Dictionary. Consideringthe extensive field which it covers, it seems to me a marvel ofpainstaking labour and general accuracy. With regard to the scientificand technical words so extensively introduced into it, I must say, thatin this respect I know no Dictionary that so satisfactorily meets a realand widely felt want in our literature of reference. I have compared itwith the large and costly works of Latham, Wedgwood, and others, andfind that in the fulness of its details, and the clearness of itsdefinitions, it holds its own even against them. The etymology has beentreated throughout with much intelligence, the most distinguishedauthorities, and the most recent discoveries in philological sciencehaving been laid under careful contribution.”--_Richard D. Graham, Esq.,English Master, College for Daughters of Ministers of the Church ofScotland, and of Professors in the Scottish Universities._“For clearness of printing, neatness of arrangement, and amount ofinformation, this Dictionary leaves nothing to be desired; while itscorrectness and condensed form giving all that is necessary with noredundance, will prove of great service to all who want a work ofcomplete and easy reference, without having recourse to a Cyclopedia. Inall cases where I have referred to the etymology, I have found it mostsatisfactory; once or twice after being unable to find a word in anotherDictionary, I have met what I wanted in this one.”--_John Wingfield,Esq., M.A._THE SCHOOL ETYMOLOGICAL DICTIONARY AND WORD-BOOK. Combining theadvantages of an ordinary Pronouncing School Dictionary and anEtymological Spelling-Book. By the Rev. JAMES STORMONTH. Fcap. 8vo, pp.254, 2s.“This is mainly an abridgment of Mr Stormonth’s larger EtymologicalDictionary, which has already been favourably criticised in ‘TheSchoolmaster.’ The Dictionary, which contains every word in ordinaryuse, is followed up by a carefully prepared list of prefixes andpostfixes, with illustrative examples, and a vocabulary of Latin, Greek,and other root-words, followed by derived English words. It will beobvious to every experienced teacher, that these lists may be madeavailable in many ways for imparting a sound knowledge of the Englishlanguage, and for helping unfortunate pupils over the terribledifficulties of our unsystematic and stubborn orthography. We think thisvolume will be a valuable addition to the pupil’s store of books, and,if rightly used, will prove a safe and suggestive guide to a sound andthorough knowledge of his native tongue.”--_The Schoolmaster._“For these reasons we always advocate the good old practice of teachingchildren English to a large extent by means of lists of spellings, allbut the most elementary classes learning spellings with ‘meanings.’ MrStormonth, in this admirable word-book, has provided the means ofcarrying out our principle in the higher classes, and of correcting allthe inexactness and want of completeness to which the English student ofEnglish is liable. His book is an etymological dictionary curtailed andcondensed.... As a dictionary the book is very carefully compiled, andmuch labour has been expended on the task of economising words and spacewith as little actual loss to the student as possible. The pronunciationis indicated by a neat system of symbols, easily mastered at the outset,and indeed pretty nearly speaking for themselves.”--_School BoardChronicle._“A concise handy-book of this kind was much wanted in schools, for mostpocket-dictionaries are by no means reliable guides. Besides the wordand its meaning, the pronunciation is given in each case, together withthe kindred or root words in other languages. The work seems verycomplete.”--_Educational Times._“The derivations are particularly good.”--_Westminster Review._“This cheap and careful abridgment of Mr Stormonth’s larger Dictionary,which has met with so cordial a welcome in all quarters, will bereceived as a boon by all interested in the education of the young....We heartily endorse its claim to be ‘a thoroughly practical school-book,and fitted for daily use by the pupil in and out of the school-room, inthe preparation of the English lessons.’”--_Aberdeen Herald._“The work is admirably adapted for teaching the meanings of words, sinceafter the meanings of the various postfixes have been learnt, the pupilwill obtain excellent exercise in the formation of words derived fromthose given in the Dictionary.”--_Mechanics’ Magazine._       *       *       *       *       *_NOW COMPLETE._ANCIENT CLASSICSFORENGLISH READERSBY VARIOUS AUTHORS.EDITED BYREV. W. LUCAS COLLINS, M.A.Author of ‘Etoniana,’ ‘The Public Schools,’ &c.OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.“We gladly avail ourselves of this opportunity to recommend the othervolumes of this useful series, most of which are executed withdiscrimination and ability.”--_Quarterly Review._“These Ancient Classics have, without an exception, a twofold value.They are rich in literary interest, and they are rich in social andhistorical interest. We not only have a faithful presentation of thestamp and quality of the literature which the master-minds of theclassical world have bequeathed to the modern world, but we have aseries of admirably vivid and graphic pictures of what life at Athensand Rome was. We are not merely taken back over a space of twentycenturies, and placed immediately under the shadow of the Acropolis, orin the very heart of the Forum, but we are at once brought behind thescenes of the old Roman and Athenian existence. As we see how the heroesof this ‘new world which is the old’ plotted, intrigued, and planned;how private ambition and political partisanship were dominant and activemotives then as they are now; how the passions and the prejudices whichreign supreme now reigned supreme then; above all, as we discover howcompletely many of what we may have been accustomed to consider our mostessentially modern thoughts and sayings have been anticipated by thepoets and orators, the philosophers and historians, who drank theirinspiration by the banks of Ilissus or on the plains of Tiber, we areprompted to ask whether the advance of some twenty centuries has workedany great change in humanity, and whether, substituting the coat for thetoga, the park for the Campus Martius, the Houses of Parliament for theForum, Cicero might not have been a public man in London as well as anorator in Rome?”--_Morning Advertiser._“It is difficult to estimate too highly the value of such a series asthis in giving ‘English readers’ an insight, exact as far as it goes,into those olden times which are so remote and yet to many of us soclose. It is in no wise to be looked upon as a rival to the translationswhich have at no time been brought forth in greater abundance or ingreater excellence than in our own day. On the contrary, we should hopethat these little volumes would be in many cases but a kind ofstepping-stone to the larger works, and would lead many who otherwisewould have remained in ignorance of them to turn to the versions ofConington, Worsley, Derby, or Lytton. In any case a reader would comewith far greater knowledge, and therefore with far greater enjoyment, tothe complete translation, who had first had the ground broken for him byone of these volumes.”--_Saturday Review, Jan. 18._       *       *       *       *       *Now complete, in 20 vols., fcap. 8vo, 2s. 6d. each,_Ancient Classics for English Readers._1.--HOMER: THE ILIAD.

And he meets his death, like Achilles, by a wound in thatspot, dealt treacherously.[9] Nat. Hist., xvi. 44.[10] The mythology of Homer supposes the gods to dwell in an aërialcity on Mount Olympus (in the north-east of Thessaly), whose summitwas always veiled in cloud, and from which there was imagined to be anopening into the heavens.[11] Why specially “blameless?” has been sometimes asked. The author ofthe ‘Mill on the Floss’ suggests that it was because they lived so faroff that they had no neighbours to criticise them.[12] Translations, 1863.[13] It may be satisfactory to a matter-of-fact reader to know thatEurybates, his attendant, takes care of it. The old Greek bard is muchmore particular on such points than modern novelists, who make eventheir heroines take sudden journeys without (apparently) having anychance of carrying with them so much as a _sac-de-nuit_.[14] Page 17.[15] Macaulay’s Lays of Ancient Rome.[16] Book iii. st. 12.[17] There is a parallel, probably quite unconscious and therefore ahigher testimony to the truth of Homer’s simile, in Kinglake’s vividdescription of the charge of Scarlett’s brigade on the Russian cavalryat Balaclava: “As heard on the edge of the Chersonese, a mile and ahalf towards the west, the collected roar which arose from this thicketof intermixed combatants had the unity of sound which belongs to themoan of a distant sea.”--Kinglake’s Crimea, iv. 174.[18] The idea is borrowed by Milton in a well-known passage;--                              “To nobler sights    Michael from Adam’s eyes the film removed    Which that false fruit, which promised clearer sight,    Had bred; then purged with euphrasy and rue    The visual nerve, for he had much to see.”            --Par. Lost, xi. 411.[19] There is pretty good authority for considering the whole of thisnight expedition, which forms a separate book (the tenth) in thedivision of the poem, as an interpolation. It is a separate lay of anexploit performed by Ulysses and Diomed, and certainly does not in anyway affect the action of the poem.[20] Eustathius, as quoted by Pope.[21] Madame Dacier’s remarks on this valuation, and Pope’s note uponthem, are amusing:--“I cannot in civility neglect a remark made upon this passage byMadame Dacier, who highly resents the affront put upon her sex by theancients, who set (it seems) thrice the value upon a tripod as upon abeautiful female slave. Nay, she is afraid, the value of women is notraised even in our days; for she says there are curious persons nowliving who had rather have a true antique kettle than the finest womanalive. I confess I entirely agree with the lady, and must impute suchopinions of the fair sex to want of taste in both ancients and moderns.The reader may remember that these tripods were of no use, but madeentirely for show; and consequently the most satirical critick couldonly say, the woman and tripod ought to have borne an equal value.”[22] Liter. of Anc. Greece, i. 349.[23] Short Studies on Great Subjects, ii. 175.[24] Guido de Colonna.[25] Gladstone.[26] See Iliad, p. 143.[27] Ulysses Homer; or, a Discovery of the True Author of the Iliad andOdyssey. By Constantine Koliades.[28] B. xiii. 345 (st. 45, Worsley).[29] Probably the modern Coryphasium.[30] See Hayman’s Odyssey, I. 118, note.[31] The Esquimaux adopt the very same stratagem in order to get nearthe seals. “Sir Edward Beecher, in a dissertation on Esquimaux habitsread before the British Association, told a story, that he was oncelevelling his rifle at a supposed seal, when a shipmate’s well-knownvoice from within the hide arrested his aim with the words, ‘Don’tshoot--it’s Husky, sir!’”--Hayman’s Odyssey, app. xliii.[32] Possibly Corfu, if the geography is to be at all identified.[33] This humorous impersonation of one of the lowest, but certainlythe strongest, influences of our common nature, has been made use ofby later writers. The Roman poets Virgil and Persius take up Homer’sidea; and Rabelais, closely following the latter, introduces hisreaders to a certain powerful personage whom he found surrounded byworshippers--“one Master Gaster, the greatest Master of Arts in theworld.” [“Gaster” is Homer’s Greek word, which Mr Worsley renders by“appetite,” but which is more literally Englished by the old Scripturalword “belly.”][34] The Greek historian Herodotus places a tribe of lotus-eaters,“who live by eating nothing but the fruit of the lotus,” on the coastof Africa somewhere near Tripoli. Pliny and other ancient writers onnatural history speak of this fruit as in shape like an olive, with aflavour like that of figs or dates, not only pleasant to eat fresh, butwhich, when dry, was made into a kind of meal. The English travellersShaw and Park found (in the close neighbourhood of Herodotus’lotus-eaters) what they thought to be the true lotus--a shrub bearing“small farinaceous berries, of a yellow colour and delicious taste.”Park says--“An army may very well have been fed with the bread I havetasted made of the meal of the fruit, as is said by Pliny to havebeen done in Libya.” There is also a water-plant in Egypt mentionedby Herodotus under the name of lotus--probably the _Nymphæa lotus_ ofLinnæus.[35] Tennyson, “The Lotus-Eaters.”[36] So sensible was Fénélon of this contrast that, in his romancealready mentioned, when he describes Calypso’s cave, he thinks itnecessary, like a true Frenchman of the days of the great Louis, almostto apologise for the rude simplicity of nature, as hardly befitting soenchanting a personage. There were no statues, he says, no pictures, nopainted ceilings, but the roof was set with shells and pebbles, and thewant of tapestry was supplied by the tendrils of a vine.[37] So the Spirit, in Milton’s “Comus,” gives to the brother of theLady a sure antidote to the spell of the enchanter (himself representedas a son of Circe):--    “Among the rest a small unsightly root,     But of divine effect, he culled me out;     The leaf was darkish, and had prickles on’t,     But in another country, as he said,     Bore a bright golden flower, but not in this soil:     Unknown, and like esteemed, and the dull swain     Treads on it daily with his clouted shoon;     And yet more med’cinal is it than that Moly     That Hermes once to wise Ulysses gave.”[38] The judges of the Dead--Minos, Rhadamanthus, and Æacus.[39] ‘Faery Queen,’ Book ii. c. 12.[40] When Adam Bede speaks roughly to his mother, and then tenderly tohis dog Gyp, the author thus moralises on his inconsistency: “We areapt to be kinder to the brutes that love us than to the women that loveus. Is it because the brutes are _dumb_?”[41] From this maternal ancestor Ulysses might have inherited a largeshare of the subtlety which distinguished him. Autolycus was thereputed son of Hermes (Mercury)--the god of thieves--and did not inthat point disgrace his blood. He was said to have the power of sotransforming all stolen property, that the owner could not possiblyrecognise it. Shakespeare borrows the name, and some of the qualities,for one of his characters in the ‘Winter’s Tale’--“Autolycus, a rogue,”as he stands in the list of _dramatis personæ_, who professes himself“not naturally honest, but sometimes so by chance.”[42] Πολλὰ μεταξὺ πέλει κύλικος καὶ χείλεος ἄκρου[43] The Straits of Gibraltar.[44] The metaphor is Homer’s, Odyss. xi. 124.[45] “Qui nescit dissimulare, nescit regnare.”[46] Shaftesbury’s Characteristics.[47] Il. x. 150.[48] Isa. xiii. 16.[49] Ezra ix. 3.[50] Jer. ix. 17.[51] Il. xxiv. 720.[52] 1 Sam. xxi. 9.[53] Il. xxiii. 329.[54] Il. xv. 36.
